Scott-Hayward 14 January 2022 Welcome Welcome to an Introduction to Statistics. This is an introductory course on statistical methods. The focus will be on how to undertake an exploratory data analysis in R. The target audience is anyone who wants to understand basic statistical concepts to summarise and visualise data and undertake simple analysis. The core material consists of: explanatory material containing the core factual content of the module, exercise/reflective questions (in bold) with answers provided at the end of the chapter, sections of R code to illustrate how to implement the ideas developed in each chapter - the code appears in courier font in a shaded box. Throughout the course, standard statistical and mathematical notation is used to express the concepts precisely. Common notation can be found in the appendix. Computer practicals The statistical programming enviroment R and user-friendly interface RStudio will be used. It would be helpful if R and RStudio are installed on your laptop before the course starts. Both programs are freely available and there are versions for both Windows and Mac. Here are some short videos to help you with the software installation and an optional link to an opinionated tour of RStudio for new users and a step-by-step guide to installing and using R packages. How to install R: https://vimeo.com/203516510 How to install RStudio: https://vimeo.com/203516968 Optional - Basic Basics lesson unit from from R-Ladies Sydney https://rladiessydney.org/courses/ryouwithme/01-basicbasics-0/ A basic guide to R terminology, notation and key functions is provided in the appendix to the core material. Several data sets are used as part of the computer practicals - a brief description of each is available in the appendix. The data files will be available to be downloaded from Moodle.

The term statistics can have a wide range of meaning and usage. Below are some thoughts of others. Statistics is the science of collecting, organizing, and interpreting numerical facts,which we call data. Moore &amp; McCabe(1993) The subject matter of statistics is the process of finding out more about the real world by collecting and then making sense of data. Wild &amp; Seber (1999) Statistics is away of reasoning, along with a collection of tools and methods,designed to help us understand the world. Richard Veaux (2006) I keep saying the sexy job in the next ten years will be statisticians. People think Im joking, but who wouldve guessed that computer engineers wouldve been the sexy job of the 1990s? Hal Varian, Chief Economist at Google (Anonymous 2009b) More cynically: In earlier times, they had no statistics, and so they had to fall back on lies. Apocryphally attributed to Steven Leacock, Economist Scientists use numbers for a variety of reasons. Numbers are a universal, precise language that can be understood by all. Consider the distinction between I saw some whales and I saw 21 whales; the quantity some is open to interpretation whereas 21 is precise. Numbers can express amounts (e.g. 30 bushels of corn), express centrality (e.g. the average male Briton is 176 cm tall) and express variation (the minimum score was 10 and the maximum was 100). By using probability (see Chapter 4), we can express uncertainty (e.g. there is a 50% chance that it is going to rain). We can distinguish pattern, or signal, from random noise and classify things. Using numbers can aid objectivity; qualitative judgements may be more open to bias. That isnt to say that quantitative judgements cannot be biased, but it can be easier to identify any biases. Putting all these things together, ultimately we can use numbers to test, or assign a relative value, to different hypotheses. Statistics distinguishes itself within the mathematical sciences by its focus (or even obsession) with randomness - it is the inherent unpredictability of many real-world problems that forces us to quantify our uncertainty and express our answers probabilistically. This frank admission of uncertainty is what makes the statistical treatment of problems honest, yet it is arguably responsible for the poor press that statistics and statisticians often receive. However, the admission of uncertainty in an answer is far preferable to expressing incorrect answers with great certainty - it is rare to be able to draw certainties from the analysis of real data. Better to be roughly right than exactly wrong (Fingland 2011). 1.3 Why model? Model - A simplified or idealized description or conception of a particular system, situation, or process, often in mathematical terms, that is put forward as a basis for theoretical or empirical understanding, or for calculations, predictions, etc.; a conceptual or mental representation of something. Oxford English Dictionary (1989) Essentially all models are wrong, but some models are useful G.E.P. Box (1976) The quote by G.E.P. Box is particularly apposite; the purpose of a model is typically for explanation and prediction. Explanation can come from building and using the model; prediction only from using the model. In a statistical context, they are mathematical abstractions of a reality where the variation in the system is simplified and characterised as a distribution (see Chapters 5 and 6). Models are often mechanistic, i.e. the model explains the processes that occur in the system of interest. Meteorologists might create a model of atmospheric processes in order to predict the weather. It may contain terms for pressure, temperature and proportions of different gases in the atmosphere. However, not all models need to be mechanistic. A pragmatic statistician might create a model to try and answer the question If it rained today, what is the probability it will rain tomorrow? such a model does not explain the weather but it might adequately predict the weather. 1.4 Examples of statistical claims There are lots of numerical claims about the real world; a few are listed below. How reliable are the claims? 1.4.1 Coffee may reverse Alzheimers Drinking five cups of coffee a day could reverse memory problems seen in Alzheimers disease, US scientists say. The 55 mice used in the University of South Florida study had been bred to develop symptoms of Alzheimers disease. When the mice were tested again after two months, those who were given the caffeine performed much better on tests measuring their memory and thinking skills and performed as well as mice of the same age without dementia. BBC 5th July (2009a) Q1.1 Should we rely on this claim? Q1.2 Can we generalise our results from 55 mice to humans? 1.4.2 Abundance of prized sturgeon Experts cant agree how many beluga sturgeon are left in the sea. At stake is the future of one of the worlds most sought-after fish and its coveted black gold. New Scientist, 20 Sept. (2003) CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) said there were 11.6 million beluga sturgeon in 2002; the Wildlife Conservation Society says maybe less than 0.5 million. Q1.3 Why would estimates from different sources vary so much? Q1.4 How would you approach such a problem? Q1.5 What if you had very limited resources to try and answer such a problem? 1.4.3 Extrapolating sprinting speed A brief article in Nature (Tatem et al. 2004) stated that Women sprinters are closing the gap on men and may one day overtake them (Figure 1.1). Figure 1.1: A paper from Nature Q1.6 Does this seem reasonable to you? Why? Q1.7 What is the population they are generalising to? 1.4.4 MMR innoculation and autism If a young child receives the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccination, are they more likely to become autistic than a child that did not receive the vaccination? In a 1998 paper in the Lancet, Andrew Wakefield and co-authors suggested that the MMR vaccination led to intestinal abnormalities, resulting in impaired intestinal function and developmental, 24 hours upto a few weeks of vaccination. This hypothesis was based on 12 children (Wakefield et al. 1998). This led to a considerable drop in the percentage of infants and young children being vaccinated. Some problems identified with this work were: too small a sample, not a random nor representative sample (the children had been referred to specialists), there was no control group of healthy children for comparison (to see what percentage had autism) 4 of the 12 children had signs of autism prior to the vaccination the authors inferred from this sample that children getting the MMR vaccination were more likely to become autistic than those not getting the vaccine. Thus generalising to all children who have had, or will have, the MMR vaccination. Subsequently, in 2004, 10 of the 13 authors of the study retracted the paper, stating that the data were insufficient to establish a causal link between the MMR vaccine and autism. Arguably the paper lowered vaccination rates in the UK. Q1.8 How safe do you think it was to generalise to all children who have had, or will have, the MMR vaccination? 1.4.5 Two SID deaths in same family How likely is it for two children in the same family to die from Sudden Infant Death (SID), or syndrome (cot death)? Mrs. Sally Clark was imprisoned in 1999 for the murder of her two infant sons. She was found guilty partially on the basis of Professor Sir Roy Meadows testimony who said that such an event, two SID deaths in the same family, should only occur with probability one in 73 million. Professor Sir David Cox, a former Professor of Statistics at Imperial College, London, told the General Medical Councils fitness to practise hearing that the odds of two children from the same family dying from sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) were much higher because they shared the same genetics and were exposed to similar environmental factors. He said Prof. Meadows testimony that the chances of Mrs Clarks two babies dying of SIDS were one in 73 million should be regarded as an error (Anonymous 2005). The use of statistics in court in the UK has recently been subject to considerable scrutiny see The Inns of Court Council of Advocacy and Royal Statistical Society (2017). 1.5 Summary Numbers and statistics potentially gives us a very powerful way of interpreting and reaching conclusions about the world but they should be used carefully with consideration of bias and uncertainty. This course will help you to critically consider numeric data supplied in news articles and the different types of statistics that are reported. 1.6 Answers Q1.1 We should be cautious relying on this claim, see next answer. Q1.2 Consider this as a two stage problem. Can we generalise from 55 mice to all mice (of the species Mus muscularis)? Perhaps we can, but the laboratory strain of mice might be different to wild mice. Extrapolating to humans may be possible if the physiology of coffee metabolism is similar across species - but it might not be. Dogs, for example, metabolise theobromine, a toxic component of chocolate, at a far slower rate than humans. As a result chocolate is toxic for dogs but is not for humans. Q1.3 Presumably CITES and the Wildlife Conservation Society are using different methods to estimate the sturgeon population. One or both may be wrong. Q1.4 There could be a variety of ways to tackle a problem like this. The fish population could be estimated by seeing how many are captured by fishermen over a given area of ocean. Alternatively perhaps fishes could be marked and released and then recaptured which would allow an estimate of the population size. Q1.5 Requiring fishermen to report their catch accurately might be the cheapest method, otherwise, a dedicated mark recapture approach as in the question above might be necessary. Q1.6 It is a massive extrapolation into the future which assumes a linear trend. There must be a limit to the improvement in sprinter speed. A sprint could not be undertaken in zero seconds! Q1.7 The population here is not men or women but sprint speeds of men and women. Q1.8 Given it was a biased sample it was probably very unsafe to generalise to all children.

This chapter outlines processes which are used to obtain data in order to draw sound conclusions. The basic techniques incorporate some form of random sampling. This chapter describes the need for sampling, basic sampling strategies, common problems that can afflict the sampling process, and the terminology required. By the end of the this unit, you should be able to: understand the basic principles of sampling appreciate the sorts of biases that may occur distinguish between accuracy and precision understand the difference between experiments and observational studies. 2.1.1 Terminology We need a common language to talk concisely about statistics and here introduce terms related to sampling that will be used throughout the course: Sampling unit : an individual object, animal, or person, on which measurements can be made. Essentially this is a discrete entity which is the basis of statistical inference. Target population: the overall collection of potential sampling units about which we want to make some inference. Census: when the entire target population is sampled/measured. Sampling protocol or design: the procedure, or strategy, for selecting sampling units from the target population. Sample: a subset of the target population for which measurements on sampling units are made. Variable: a characteristic defined for each sampling unit (e.g. age, weight, blood group) and are typically denoted by lower case Roman letters (e.g. \\(x\\), \\(y\\) represent vectors containing measurements for each sampling unit). Parameter: a numerical summary for the target population (e.g. the mean height of adults in the UK) and are typically denoted by Greek letters (e.g. \\(\\mu\\), \\(\\sigma\\)) or a numerical characteristic of a statistical model. Estimate/Statistic: a numerical summary of a variable for the sample (e.g. the proportion of a sample of UK citizens that favour a particular political party). Different notation conventions apply to represent estimates from samples, but generally lower case Roman letters are used (e.g. \\(\\bar x\\) represents the mean of sample data denoted by \\(x\\)). Note, these statistics are often estimates of a population parameter (e.g. \\(\\bar x\\) estimates \\(\\mu\\)). 2.2 What is sampling and why do it? Suppose a landowner has 200 acres of forest where the trees ready for harvest and plans to sell the timber; how could we determine the volume of wood from the forest to get an idea of monetary value? A tree could be a sampling unit and one approach would be to visit every tree, measure its total height, diameter at various heights and calculate the volume. We may also want to grade the tree in terms of percentage of good wood, lack of defects, decay, etc. In essence, we would be conducting a census of the trees. However, visiting and measuring every tree could be prohibitively expensive, taking far too much time and money. Therefore, we dont measure all the trees but instead take a sample of plots of land (i.e., a subset of the forest), estimate the volume and grade of trees for each subset. From this the average volume on a plot can be obtained and multiplying this by the total number of plots in the forest will result in an estimate of the total volume of wood in the forest. In this example, the trees are not necessarily damaged by measuring. In some cases, however, taking a measurement can involve damaging or destroying the unit involved. For example, quality control testing of cans of fizzy drink may involve opening the cans to measure the contents. Taking a census (or indeed sampling a large proportion of the target population) would be clearly counter-productive. In many cases, it may not be necessary to know the true (i.e. population) parameter and an estimate will be sufficient. For example, we may not need to know the true volume of wood in the forest and an estimate will be good enough to get an idea of the monetary value of the forest. Therefore, sampling is used rather than take a census. This may be because because we cant measure the entire population: it would be too expensive, take too much time and effort, is impractical or impossible. 2.2.1 Precision, accuracy and bias In sampling, we take a sample from a target population and generate a statistic of interest. Suppose we are interested in establishing the proportion of undergraduate students in the University of St Andrews who have a driving licence. We might select a sample of students, ask them whether they have a driving licence and calculate the sample proportion. Image repeating this process with many samples of students. It is likely that the sample proportion will be different for each sample. Ideally, we would like our statistic to be accurate, precise and unbiased (top right in Figure 2.1), where accuracy implies that each sample statistic is similar to the population parameter precision implies that the value of the sample statistic is similar for all samples, and bias implies that the sample statistic tends to differ from the population parameter in some consistent way (i.e. there is a systematic error). In general, a sample statistic will be some combination of the population parameter being estimated plus any bias and some random variability. Figure 2.1: The centre of the target indicates the true value of the parameter and the dots are sample statistics. Q2.1 A headline on the BBC website stated that Vapers rise to more than three million in Britain (BBC, 14/09/2018). The article goes onto state that the numbers of e-cigarette users has risen from from 2.9m to 3.2m between 2017 and 2018 - a rise of 10%. It is likely that a sampling survey has been undertaken to obtain these numbers. a. What is the target population? b. What is the sampling unit? c. What is the variable being measured? d. What is the population parameter? e. What is the sample estimate? 2.3 Three types of data collection There are three general procedures for collecting data and each are covered in this chapter: sample surveys (and polls) designed experiments observational studies. Statisticians make a distinction between experiments and observation studies (also known as quasi-experiments).1 It is important to emphasise that how data are collected affects the ability to learn about the world. Flawed data collection procedures can make it impossible, or nearly so, to arrive at quality decisions or to make accurate statements. In many cases, no amount of sophisticated data analysis procedures will remedy bad data. Notably, whatever method is used for the collection/generation of data, sampling is likely to underpin the collection process. From the outset there is inherent uncertainty surrounding our ability to produce answers for a population from a sample, hence, robust sampling strategies need to be used when selecting a sample. 2.3.1 Common, but unwise, data collection strategies For sample estimates to be applicable to the target population from which the sample was taken, the sample needs to be representative. Two approaches to sampling which generally lead to unrepresentative (i.e. biased) samples are anecdotal evidence and self-selected samples. Anecdotal evidence can be based on haphazardly selected individual cases, which often come to our attention because they are striking in some way. These cases need not be representative of any larger group of cases. Self-selected, or voluntary response, samples are commonplace; magazines and newspapers often include questionnaires that readers can complete and send back. Internet polls are much the same, as are opt-in surveys: individuals choose whether or not they want to respond and hence be included in the sample. Principally, we want any sample statistic to have: high precision/low uncertainty, high accuracy, and hence low bias, as per top right panel in Figure 2.1. There can be many sources of inaccuracy and/or a lack of precision, but fortunately some of them can be controlled. Sampling is a just such a controllable source and three frequently used strategies are described below. Q2.2 Considering phone-in programmes on the radio, are the opinions expressed representative of the UK population, or even of all the people who listen to the radio show? What type of person is likely to call? 2.4 Simple sampling approaches Having decided to take a sample from our target population, the next question is how to choose the sample. All good sample schemes have two features: planned randomness, and the chance, or probability, that any given sampling unit being selected can be calculated. These features ensure that sample is representative of the population; i.e., one has controlled for selection bias, the bias that results when part of the target population is systematically excluded from the samples. Sampling is a large topic of study in itself; here we consider three basic strategies: Simple random samples Systematic random samples Stratified random samples 2.4.1 Simple random sample A simple random sample (SRS) is a subset of the target population in which each sampling unit has an equal chance of being selected. The chance, or probability, of a sampling unit being selected can be calculated easily. Say the target population is of size \\(N\\) and the sample size is \\(n\\), then the probability of an individual sampling unit being selected is \\(n/N\\). Example We want to select 10 students from a group of 150 using simple random sampling. The probability of an individual student being selected is \\(\\frac{10}{150}\\). How do we ensure that each sampling unit has an equal chance of being selected? One way would be to assign a number to each individual, write each number on a slip of paper, put the slip of papers in a hat, mix thoroughly and draw 10 slips out - the numbers on the slips of paper determine who is selected. Alternatively, a computer could be used to generate 10 numbers from a list of numbers 1 to 150. 2.4.1.1 Doing this in R # Generate a simple random sample of size 10 from a population of 150 units # Initialise necessary objects N &lt;- 150 # Size of target population n &lt;- 10 # Sample size # SRS sample(x=1:N, size=n, replace=FALSE) [1] 33 9 37 119 115 114 139 85 50 131 # The sample doesn&#39;t have to be numbers IDs &lt;- c(&quot;subject1&quot;, &quot;subject2&quot;, &quot;subject3&quot;, &quot;subject4&quot;, &quot;subject5&quot;) sample(x=IDs, size=2, replace=FALSE) [1] &quot;subject4&quot; &quot;subject1&quot; It is worth spending a minute thinking about computer-generated random numbers. Computers are not random, however, they can be effectively random with pseudo-Random Number Generators (RNGs). There are many types of RNGs, but all are effectively unpredictable without knowing a starting point. In the examples below, we generate a sample of numbers with and without specifying the starting point. First, we dont specify the starting point and so each time we generate a sample of numbers, the samples are different. # Example when the result is unpredictable # Generate 4 decimal numbers from 0 to 1 (a uniform (0,1) distribution) runif(n=4, min=0, max=1) [1] 0.3839566 0.1328483 0.6887229 0.1039757 # Repeat runif(n=4, min=0, max=1) [1] 0.2096631 0.5713851 0.4916080 0.4418365 But - with a seed, a starting point for the RNG, the generated numbers are predictable/reproducible. # Set the seed for the RNG set.seed(2343) runif(n=4, min=0, max=1) [1] 0.20467634 0.09047926 0.61101041 0.17877428 # Repeat set.seed(2343) runif(n=4, min=0, max=1) [1] 0.20467634 0.09047926 0.61101041 0.17877428 Setting the seed is useful for confirming calculations which have a stochastic, or random, component. 2.4.2 Systematic samples Suppose there are \\(N=1000\\) individuals in the target population and we want to take a sample of size \\(n=200\\). A systematic sample can be selected as follows: Calculate the fixed periodic interval, \\(k = N/n\\). In our example, this is \\(k = 1000/200 = 5\\). Randomly pick a starting number between 1 and \\(k\\), call it \\(q\\), say \\(q=3\\) Sample the \\(q\\)th individual, then the (\\(q+k\\))th, then (\\(q+2k\\))th and so on. Thus, starting at \\(q=3\\), the sample will be generated by 3, (3+5), (3+2x5), and so on; the sample will consist of sampling units 3, 8, 13, , 993, 998. Systematic samples have some advantages over SRS: it is often easier to draw since only one number is randomly selected (i.e. \\(q\\)). it will distribute the sample more evenly through the population. it will do better than a SRS if there is a trend in the values. Example We want to take a sample of customers visiting a bank. From a practical point of view, it is much easier to pick every 10th person, say, arriving in the bank than refer to a SRS of bank customers. In addition, SRS could, by chance, select a lot of customers in the morning which could be a particular subset of the customers if there is a pattern in the type of customers that arrive through the day. A systematic sample would spread the selected customers throughout the day. One thing to be aware of is, if the population contains some variation which is periodic in nature and if the fixed periodic interval (\\(k\\)) equals the periodic variation, the sample may be biased. Consider loaves of bread on a production line; each loaf is cut into 20 slices. A slice is taken from each loaf. Using a systematic sample with a fixed interval of \\(k=20\\), the sample will consist of either all crusts or no crusts, depending on the starting value. 2.4.2.1 Doing this in R The code below selects a systematic sample. # Draw a systematic random sample of size 20 from a population of 100 units # Initialise values N &lt;- 100 # Size of target population n &lt;- 20 # Sample size # Calculate fixed periodic interval k k &lt;- N/n k [1] 5 # Randomly select starting point q q &lt;- sample(1:k, size=1) q [1] 3 # Generate regular sequence seq(from=q, to=N, by=k) [1] 3 8 13 18 23 28 33 38 43 48 53 58 63 68 73 78 83 88 93 98 2.4.3 Stratified random samples In a stratified random sample, the population is divided into different groups or strata, then simple random samples are selected from each stratum. For example, we might divide the population of the university into four strata (e.g. undergraduate students, postgraduate students, academic and research staff, and support staff) and take a SRS from each strata. Why do this? Sometimes it is more convenient to organise sampling in this way and choose a SRS within a homogeneous group. The stratification ensures that all strata will be represented in the overall sample, which may not be the case for a SRS. It may be useful to examine the separate statistics from each strata. It can result in greater precision when estimating a parameter than for a SRS with the same sample size because sampling units within a stratum may be more similar (hence reducing variability). The size of the sample in each stratum can be proportional to the total number of sampling units in each stratum so that each stratum is represented equally. The proportion of sampling units in stratum \\(i\\), \\(p_i\\), can be found from \\[p_i = \\frac{N_i}{N} \\] where \\(N_i\\) is the total number of sampling units in stratum \\(i\\). For a total sample of size \\(n\\), then the number selected from group \\(i\\) can be calculated from \\[n_i = n \\times p_i\\] This strategy is frequently used in environmental studies, for example, in fisheries stock assessment where different areas (strata) are sampled with different intensity. Q2.3 In 2019, the population of the University of St Andrews was made up of members classed in one of four groups (size of the group is given in parentheses): undergraduate students (7,221), postgraduate students (1,763), academic and research staff (1,426), and support staff (1,174). a. For a simple random sample of size 500, what is the probability of an individual member of the University being selected? b. If we take a systematic sample of size 500, what is the fixed period interval, \\(k\\)? c. Assume that all members of staff are assigned a number. Given a starting number of \\(q = 12\\), what are the first five numbers of a systematic sample that would be selected using the value of \\(k\\) calculated in part 2a? d. We now want to take a stratified random sample, using the groups as the strata, and sample in proportion to the strata sizes. What will be the sample size for each group if the total sample size is 500? 2.5 Sampling biases Sampling error is incurred when the characteristics of interest in a population are estimated from a sample - it is the difference between the sample statistics and the true, but unknown, parameter of the population - and is unavoidable. There will also be random variation between samples - sampling error is also used more broadly to refer to this sample-to-sample variation. Therefore, it is important that our samples are representative of the population as a whole. In essence, we want any differences between our samples and the population to be due to random variation only and not due to other sources of error. Selecting a sample in such a way that it is unrepresentative of the target population has been mentioned and will cause bias, however, even if a random sample is selected in some way, then serious biases can still occur. 2.5.1 Non-sampling error Even though a random sample has been selected, sources of error, or bias, can occur when collecting data. A few common sources of error when surveying people in particular are listed below. Non-response bias When surveying people, a certain percentage of the sample will not provide information even though they have been selected to take part. The reasons for non-response will be many and may include not being at home, too busy, or having a dislike for pollsters. If the values of the variable(s) being measured differs between non-responders and responders, then the resulting statistic can be severely biased. Survey format The format of a survey (e.g. postal questionnaire, by telephone, in person) may affect the results. For example, respondents may not feel comfortable giving personal information to an interviewer (e.g. How old are you?) but more willing to provide the information in a postal questionnaire. Question effects Questions can be slanted in a particular way, or lead the respondent on purpose; for a well-designed survey this should be guarded against. The choice of words is also important as the following example illustrates. Example (from (Moore and McCabe 2003)) When asked How do the Scots feel about the movement to become independent from England? 51% of the sample voted for independence for Scotland, but only 34% supported an independent Scotland separate from the United Kingdom. It seems that the wording of the question had an effect; maybe independence is a nice, hopeful word while separate is a negative word. Poor quality data can also arise depending upon length of survey; the respondent may get tired or bored if there are too many questions, or question response categories, to consider. The questions should also be in some logical order and not jump between topics which may confuse the respondent. Response bias The behaviour of the respondent or of the interviewer can influence responses in several ways. An interviewer can intimidate or alienate the respondent, albeit unintentionally (e.g., different race or social class) leading the respondent to answer untruthfully. A respondent may not answer truthfully because a question may have: a social stigma (or legal implications) related to it (e.g. Have you ever been arrested?) a social prestige slant (e.g. How much money do you earn?). Respondents may answer in a way that is socially acceptable (e.g. to the question How many units of alcohol do you drink per week?) suffer from recall bias so that they cannot remember exactly when something happened or what happened (e.g. How many hours of television did you watch last Thursday?) misunderstand the question (e.g. giving weight in kilograms instead of pounds). Careful and thoughtful questionnaire design is important\\footnote{Further reading can be found here. Any questionnaire should be tested to eliminate any inconsistencies or confusion before it is used for real. Q2.4 In 1936, a magazine in the USA called the sent out 10 million questionnaires to people drawn from car registration lists and telephone directories asking who they would vote for in the upcoming election; 2.3 million questionnaires were returned. From the results, the magazine predicted a landslide victory for Republican candidate Alf Landon. In fact, the Democrat candidate, Franklin Roosevelt, won the election. With such a large number of questionnaires returned, what do you think went wrong? Q2.5 A psychologist was interested in understanding the motivation of serial killers and in estimating the mean number of victims per serial killer. The psychologist discovered there were 261 serial killers incarcerated worldwide. a. The psychologist initially planned to interview all imprisoned serial killers about various aspects of their personality. Describe the approach being used. b. This initial approach proved to be too costly, therefore, the psychologist randomly choose 80 killers to contact and ask if they were prepared to be interviewed. Thirty-nine agreed to be interviewed. Comment on the representativeness of the sample to the whole population of worldwide serial killers and what type of bias this may result in, if any. c. In choosing the initial 80 prisoners, the psychologist selected them randomly in proportion to the overall number of imprisoned serial killers in each country e.g. if 50% of the worlds convicted serial killers were in prisons in the USA, then 40 serial killers in the USA were selected at random. What sort of sampling design is this? 2.6 Experiments The (Anonymous 1980) gives the following definition (one of several) for an experiment: An action or operation undertaken in order to discover something unknown, to test a hypothesis, or establish or illustrate some known truth. In an experiment, we often try to discover whether a treatment or condition has an effect on sampling units, or experimental units, and what the nature and magnitude of that effect is. Typically there is a manipulation or intervention. Note that if the experimental units are animals, they are known as subjects and if the experimental units are humans they are increasingly referred to as participants. Experiments do not have to be done in the laboratory, they can be undertaken anywhere, for example, experiments might be used to answer the following questions: Does a certain drug improve the prospects for heart transplant patients? Does heating a wire increase its electrical resistance? How effective is an insecticide? To investigate these questions, we give different treatments to different experimental (sampling) units and measure a response. In the examples, above, these might be: Example Experimental unit Treatment 1 patient drug 2 wire heat 3 mosquito insecticide There is often some natural variability in the results of any experiment. Using statistics, we aim to disentangle this natural variation from any variation that is introduced by our treatment method. 2.6.1 Randomised experiments In a randomised experiment, treatments are randomly allocated to experimental units by the researcher. Example A new drug for heart-transplant patients is to be tested against a standard drug. Patients in the study are randomly allocated to either the new or standard drug group. Each patient in the heart-transplant study has an equal chance of being selected for the group that will be given the new drug. A difference in the response between the two groups can be attributed to the treatment because the patients were randomly allocated to treatments. Example A new insecticide is developed for the control of mosquitoes for use in countries where malaria is a significant problem. How effective is it, and will it be cheaper or more expensive to use than existing chemical treatments? The insecticide is designed for use with adult mosquitoes and a scientist might set up an experiment like this: Create 4 separate enclosures Place a sample of the same number of adult mosquitoes in each enclosure. These individuals are the experimental units in this experiment. Choose 4 different concentrations of insecticide, one for each enclosure. Apply the treatment each day by spraying enclosure with insecticide. The concentration of insecticide is a factor known as the explanatory variable. One treatment should be a control in which no insecticide is applied, but a water spray is applied (in case mosquitoes are actually killed when sprayed). Determine how many mosquitoes in each enclosure survive, and how many die (mortality, in this case, is the response variable/variable of interest). Repeat (replicate the whole experiment) 10 times. We can then see how much natural variation occurs in the results of the experiment this enables us to determine whether the treatment has a real effect on the outcome or if any differences are down to natural variability alone. Randomly assign experimental units (mosquitoes) to the 4 treatments and 10 replicates. This should get around possible biases e.g. if fitter individuals are selected for one treatment. Differences in responses should then only be due to the effect of the treatments. 2.6.2 Components of an experimental design Randomization may be carried out by assigning numbers to individuals, then picking numbers at random. Randomization is done to ensure that treatment groups are, on average, similar. Randomization is designed to avoid bias. Replication is carried out in order to: assess the amount of natural variation in the results. This way, it is possible to determine whether a treatment has a significant effect. increase precision. The more replicates, the more precise the result (but the greater the cost in time and money!) As a rule of thumb, the number of replicates should be at least twice the number of treatments with an absolute minimum of 6 per treatment. Sometimes, the experimental units (or subjects) are partitioned into stratum, or blocked. For example, in the mosquito experiment, individuals could be assigned to male and female groups (strata) before being randomly allocated to a particular treatment. This may reduce the amount of natural variability in the results of an experiment, so that the results are more precise. In studies involving human subjects, for example in drug trials, a placebo may be given to a control group. A placebo is a treatment (e.g. drug or intervention) with no known active effects e.g. sugar pills. It is given so that the patient does not know what treatment they are receiving because there may be a psychological effect when a doctor offers a patient a treatment. It may also be necessary to use double blinding so that the doctor does not know what treatment they are offering and the patient does not know what treatment they are receiving. This avoids subtle differences in the behaviour of doctors according to the treatment they are prescribing. If a randomised experiment shows a significant effect, it is possible to argue for causation i.e. that the treatment caused the effect. Example A famous and large-scale designed experiment that is still relevant today is Salks polio vaccine study. Polio (poliomyelitis) is a serious viral infection that used to be common worldwide. It caused muscle weakness from which a small percentage of people did not recover and even died. The number of cases in the US during the mid 20th century are shown in Figure 2.2. Figure 2.2: The number of polio cases from 1930 to 1955. In general, the incidence of polio was increasing over this time period. However, the incidence of disease also fluctuates from year to year, with high and low incident years sometimes alternating. Jonas Salk created a vaccine and a large-scale trial of this vaccine was conducted in the US in 1954 to determine how effective it was in protecting children from paralysis or death due to polio. Snedecor and Cochran (1980) describe the study in detail; a summary is provided here. School children were divided into two groups; one group received the vaccine (the treatment group) and the other group received no vaccine (control group). The comparison of the numbers of paralytic cases in each group were used to judge the effectiveness of the vaccine. Since severe symptoms are rare, large numbers of children were required and more than 200,000 children were recruited to each group. Within each participating school, children were randomised such that there were about equal numbers of children in each group. This stratified approach ensured that schools in high risk and low risk regions had about equal numbers of children in each group. A simple randomisation of children to the groups would mean that overall the numbers in the two groups were equal but would not take account of high and low risk regions. The children in the vaccine group received three injections of the vaccine and the children in the comparison, or control, group received three injections of a saline solution. They were given at the same time and in the same manner. A crucial aspect of the study was that neither parents, children, medics administering the vaccine or the doctors diagnosing illness knew which treatment group the children were in - this was a double-blind trial. The following table shows the numbers of children in each of the groups and the number of polio cases ((Snedecor and Cochran 1980), pg. 13): Group Number of children Polio cases per 100,000 Vaccinated 200,745 16 Control 201,229 57 The trials provided good evidence for the effectiveness of the vaccine. Regular use of polio vaccine since the Salk trial has reduced the incidence of the disease dramatically. To summarise, in an experiment we often try to determine whether a treatment (or intervention of some kind) has a significant effect. A control group is a group of units that are not exposed to the treatment. This group is generally necessary for comparison with the treatment group to assess the effectiveness of the treatment. In a randomised experiment, subjects/experimental units are assigned to the treatment or control group at random. In blocked experiments, the experimental units may first be divided into strata or groups (e.g. on the basis of age). Experiments should be replicated. In drug trials, patients in the control group may be given a placebo (an inactive pill or medicine) so that they do not know whether they are in the control or treatment group If the doctor also does not know which group the patient is in, this is a double-blind trial If a randomised experiment produces a significant effect, then we can argue for a causal link between treatment and effect. 2.6.3 Controls Controls are benchmarks required for a comparison, they are frequently used but not necessarily essential. For example, one might be interested in knowing whether having a cup of coffee elevates heart rate. Here a control is essential, otherwise how would one know if an elevation in heart rate was due to the coffee or because the heartbeat was being measured. Sometimes a control is not necessary, for example if the question was Do different sorts of coffee have different effects on heart rate? The natural experiment would be to compare different varieties of coffee, no control is required because, here, we have a contrast. Q2.6 A doctor is investigating the potential effect of a new drug in combating an as yet incurable disease. Is a control required? Q2.7 A pharmaceutical company is testing whether a new experimental drug is better than the existing treatments on the market. Is a control required? 2.7 Observational Studies Observational studies refer to data collected from nature without any kind of manipulation and so conditions are NOT under the control of the researcher. This terminology is commonly used across most of science, however alternative terminology is sometimes used; astronomers often refer to theory-based observation of stars, galaxies, gas clouds as experiments although in no sense are they manipulating the cosmos! Example Let us return to the mosquito example. Imagine that villagers have already been using the new insecticide in the field. They have used the chemical at various concentrations. A scientist surveys the area and determines the population density of mosquitoes in different locations. This scientist also collects information from the local people as to what concentration of insecticide they have been using. This looks quite similar to the previous study. However, the results are more difficult to interpret because: we do not know if there are naturally-occurring differences in mosquito population density in the different areas due to other factors. For example, there may be other animals that eat mosquitoes in one area and so the density is reduced (a confounding variable). we do not know that the mosquitoes themselves are all the same, e.g mosquitoes in one area may be genetically different to those in another area (another confounding variable). It is more difficult to argue for causation based on an observational study because of potential confounding variables. It is important to remember this when reporting on the outcome of a statistical investigation. However, in practice, observational studies often have to be used as evidence for an effect because: It may be difficult, in practice, to carry out a randomized experiment, e.g. the effects of fishing on a large ecosystem such as the North Sea cannot be explored by conducting experiments on a series of replicate oceans. It may be unethical to carry out a randomized experiment: e.g imagine that we want to know about the implications of smoking for human health. We are interested in knowing what effect of mothers smoking during pregnancy has on the average birth-weight of babies. It would not be ethical to ask a randomly-chosen group of mothers to take up smoking, because this might adversely affect their unborn babies or their own health. Therefore, we have to examine other kinds of evidence: randomised experiments carried out on animals observational studies, e.g. looking at birth weights of babies born to mothers who have chosen not to smoke and weights of babies born to mothers who have chosen not to give up smoking in pregnancy. Remember that an observational study is not a randomized experiment, we may not be able to make a strong argument for causation based on the results. For example, if it is found that babies where the mothers smoked during pregnancy have generally lower birth weight, this could be due to confounding variables, such as diet. 2.7.1 Types of observational study There are a variety of types of observational study. Some of which are given specific definitions: Cohort study: A cohort is any group of people who are linked in some way. For instance, a birth cohort includes all people born within a given time frame. Researchers compare what happens to members of the cohort that have been exposed to a particular variable to what happens to the other members who have not been exposed. Case control study: Researchers identify people with an existing health problem (cases) and a similar group without the problem (controls) and then compare the two groups with respect to an exposure or exposures. These studies can be prospective or retrospective: Prospective: none of the subjects have the disease (or other outcome of interest) when the study commences; the subjects are followed over a period of time to determine whether the disease develops. Retrospective: the researcher looks at historical data to examine previous exposure to suspected factors in relation to an outcome determined at the start of the study. Example UK Millennium cohort study Known as the Child of the New Century project, the lives of nearly 19,000 children born in the UK during 2000 and 2001 were followed. Data were collected when they were 9 months, 3, 5, 7, 11, 14 and 17 years. A large number of studies have been conducted of the data collected looking at, for example, health, behavioural problems, career aspirations. Details can be found here Example A retrospective, case control observational study on smokers To determine the death rate of men with different smoking habits, large studies were undertaken between 1951 and 1959 (1980). A questionnaire was sent to the selected group of men asking about current and past smoking habits and other information, such as age. The study compared different groups whose death rates could be compared (e.g. different types of smokers - nonsmokers, cigarettes, cigars, pipes, mixed). If death rates were found to be different between the groups it would still be difficult to conclude this was due to the smoking habits. The subjects assigned themselves to groups by their smoking habits and the groups may differ in other ways apart from their smoking habits (e.g. age, income, lifestyle). To control for other factors, the researchers must try to control for these other factors and divide the subjects into groups such that these other factors are similar. Then, for example, compare the death-rates of smokers and non-smokers who are in the same age category. Example A retrospective, case control study on sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) A large study on SIDS cases in Scotland were investigated from 1992 to 1995. When a case of SIDS occurred, the parents were interviewed to find out about methods of infant care and socioeconomic factors. Two controls were chosen for each case by identifying babies born in the same maternity unit and just before/after the SIDS baby, thus controlling for time of year and age and maternity unit. More details here To summarise, there are two main types of observational study, cohort and case control studies. A prospective study is one in which samples are chosen, and variables measured, and the subjects (or units) are subsequently observed over time in order to observe the outcomes. The relationship between the initial measured variable on the outcome can be studied. In a retrospective case-control study, cases in which a certain outcome has occurred are compared with controls in which that outcome has not occurred. Differences between the case and control groups may indicate factors that are correlated with certain outcomes. A confounding variable is some factor not accounted for, which introduces a difference in outcomes between treatment groups that is NOT due to the effects of the treatment. It is generally not possible to infer causation from an observational study: it is difficult to exclude the possible effects of confounding variables. 2.8 Observational studies vs experiments Observation studies have advantages in that they: can often be cheaper, the results are collected from observation rather than requiring active intervention. effects can be investigated that would be unethical to manipulate e.g. the action of living near nuclear waste depositories on the risk of cancer - people cannot be foreced to live near nuclear power stations. Experiments have advantages in that they: allow the investigation of variables that might not occur naturally causation can be easier to infer if there has been a direct manipulation. Q2.8 An evil industrialist has deliberately created an oil spill to prevent an area being recognised as a conservation zone. You as a statistical ecologist are conducting a survey of species diversity to compare to an earlier survey done prior to the oil spill? Is this an experiment or observational study? Q2.9 The evil industrialist is also a statistical ecologist and he conducts and analyses a survey of the polluted area. Is this an experiment or observational study? 2.9 Summary Any well-designed sampling survey needs to have some random component included when selecting the sampling units in order to avoid bias. Several strategies can be implemented to select the sample depending on the aim of the study. However, even with a randomly selected sample, non-sampling biases can occur, particularly when studying people. Therefore, careful thought is required to decide what data to collect and how to collect it. In randomised designed experiments one can argue that some treatment, or intervention, has caused the observed effect. However in some situations, experiments are not appropriate and so observational studies are used. Further reading on the subject can be found in (De Veaux, Velleman, and Bock 2006) or (Wild and Seber 1999). 2.9.1 Learning objectives This unit has covered: the basic forms of data collection the basic principles of sampling and illustrated different sampling strategies, illustrated the difference between accuracy and precision, highlighted the sorts of biases that may occur and described the differences between designed experiments and observational studies. 2.10 Answers Q2.1 a. The target population is the adults in the Great Britain. Q2.1 b. A sampling unit will be an adult in Great Britain. The article indicated that 12,000 British adults were sampled. Q2.1 c. The variable being measured on each sampling unit will be e-cigarette use, with likely values user or not user (or yes or no). Q2.1 d. The population parameter will be the true number (or proportion) of e-cigarette users in Great British adults. Q2.1 e. The sample estimate is the number (or proportion) of e-cigarette users in the sample of British adults. Q2.2 It is likely that the people who phone in to the radio station hold strong feelings or opinions which may not reflect the opinions all those who listen or indeed of the general population. Q2.3 a. Calculate the total population size \\[ N = 7221 + 1763 + 1426 + 1174 = 11584\\] The probability of an individual being selected is \\[ \\frac{n}{N} = \\frac{500}{11584} = 0.043\\] Each member of the university has a 0.043 chance of being selected in the sample. Q2.3 b. For a systematic sample, the fixed periodic interval is given by \\[k = \\frac{N}n = \\frac{11584}{500} = 23.186 \\sim 23\\] Q2.3 c. The first five elements of a systematic sample will be (\\(q, q+k, q+2k, q+3k, q+4k)\\). Thus, if \\(k\\)=23 and \\(q=12\\), the first five individuals selected will be (12, 35, 58, 81 and 104). Q2.3 d. To calculate the sample size of each stratum, we first need to calculate the proportion of members in each strata. This is given by: Undergraduates: \\[\\frac{7221}{11584} = 0.623 \\] Postgraduates: \\[\\frac{1763}{11584} = 0.152 \\] Academic and research staff: \\[\\frac{1426}{11584} = 0.123 \\] Support staff: \\[\\frac{1174}{11584} = 0.101 \\] Using these proportions, we can calculate the size of the sample in each group Undergraduates: \\[500 \\times 0.623 = 311.68 \\sim 312 \\] individuals Postgraduates: \\[500 \\times 0.152 = 76.01 \\sim 76 \\] Academic and research staff: \\[500 \\times 123 = 61.56 \\sim 62 \\] Support staff: \\[500 \\times 0.101 = 50.67 \\sim 51 \\] Note: this gives a total sample of 501 and so you can choose either to reduce one of the groups by one, or have a sample of 501 individuals. Performing these calculations in R forms the basis of computer practical 2. Q2.4 (Squire 1988) identified several problems which compounded the error in the result: the sampling procedure was flawed - there were differences in voting patterns between those who received a questionnaire (i.e. those with car and/or a telephone) and those who did not receive a questionnaire, a low response rate - although a large number of questionnaires were returned, this was still less than 25% of the total sent out, non-response bias - those who returned their questionnaires favoured Landon. As an aside, George Gallup conducted a poll of 50,000 people and correctly predicted the result. Gallup remains a prominent election-polling organisation today. Q2.5 a. This is a census of the imprisoned serial killer population and a sample (presumably not random) of the entire worldwide serial killer population. Q2.5 b. Whilst the psychologist chose a random sample of serial killers, there may be a non-response bias in that only some chose to respond. These prisoners might have a different psychology compared to those that refused to participate. There is another problem too; the imprisoned serial killers are a biased sample of the whole population of serial killers. Potential serial killers who are arrested after their first murder are not defined as serial killers and thus not included in the population. In addition, those not caught, presumably, could kill more than those who are imprisoned, thus, the mean number of victims could be under-estimated. Q2.5 c. This is a stratified sampling scheme with country being the strata. Q2.6 Yes. This question asks whether the drug works at all, so a control is required for comparison. Q2.7 No. In this question, the drug is being compared to existing drugs so it is a contrast. Q2.8 There is no definitive answer; one could argue that as the statistical ecologist did not create the conditions, it is an observational study. Q2.9 It could be argued that because the industrialist deliberately manipulated the environment it is an experiment!

Carly Fiorina, former chief executive officer, Hewlett Packard In chapter 2, different data collection methods were discussed. Having obtained some data, the first stage of any analysis is to perform an exploratory investigation to extract summaries of the data, such as the number of observations and average values and to plot it. In this chapter we consider methods to summarise data both visually and numerically. First, we consider types of data because the methods used for both simple, and more complex, analyses will depend on the type of data; for example, eye colour (e.g. blue, brown) cannot be described by a numerical average which could be used to describe a variable like height. By the end of this unit you should be able to: distinguish between the different types of data calculate basic numerical summaries for data know which plots are applicable to different types of data. 3.2 Types of data There are two general categories of variables: quantitative and qualitative. Quantitative data measure some quantity resulting in a numerical value, e.g. weight, salary. Qualitative data measure the quality of something resulting in a value that does not have a numerical meaning, e.g. colour, religion, season. These general types can be partitioned further: Quantitative Discrete: data with distinct values and the possible values take only a distinct series of numbers (e.g. number of traffic accidents, number of children born to a women) Continuous: a value that can be measured evermore precisely and hence become essentially continuous (e.g. height, speed). For convenience, continuous data is often truncated to discrete values: for example, height may be reported to the nearest centimetre, (e.g. I might say my height is 167 cm rather than 167.2345 cm); and age is generally reported in years rather than in years, months, days and hours etc. Qualitative Ordinal: non-numeric value but the values have some natural ordering; e.g. poor, fair, good, excellent. Nominal: unordered, distinct by name only; e.g. green, red, white. 3.3 Frequency distributions For discrete variables, with a limited number of distinct values, or qualitative variables, the frequency distribution is a useful summary. It is formed by counting the number or frequency of each distinct value. Suppose that a variable (which we will call \\(z\\)) could take values from 1 to 10, inclusive. The following 20 values had been recorded, and sorted in value order, \\(z=\\){2,2,2,2,2,3,4,4,5,5,5,6,7,7,8,8,8,8,10,10}. The frequency distribution would be formed by counting the number of 1s, 2s, 3s and so on. For this example, the frequency distribution of \\(z\\) is shown in Table 3.1. Table 3.1: Frequency distribution of variable \\(z\\). z Frequency 1 0 2 5 3 1 4 2 5 3 6 1 7 2 8 4 9 0 10 2 From this summary, it is straightforward to identify the mode, the most frequently recorded value. In this case, the mode is 2; the number 2 was recorded five times, which was more than any other value. For continuous data, or discrete data with a large number of distinct values, the values are grouped into classes to form the frequency distribution. For example, if the heights of 100 adults had been measured to the nearest cm, then the frequency distribution may be created by counting the number of heights in the classes 151-155cm, 156-160cm, 161-165cm, and so on. 3.3.1 Doing this in R There is a useful command in R which tabulates the number of records for each distinct value but note that it does not include possible values that were not recorded (e.g. in the sample set \\(z\\), 1 and 9 were not recorded). # Create object containing values z &lt;- c(2,2,2,2,2,3,4,4,5,5,5,6,7,7,8,8,8,8,10,10) # Get frequencies table(z) z 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 10 5 1 2 3 1 2 4 2 3.4 Numerical summaries The frequency distribution distills the data into a useful table which contains all the information about that recorded variable. However, we generally want to summarise the data with a numerical summary rather than a table and to summarise a variable fully, we want to calculate a measure of centre (or central tendency) and a measure of spread (or variability). Knowing something about both the centre and spread is far more informative than just one measure alone. The mode, mentioned previously, can be considered as a measure of the centre. The other measures we consider are the mean and median. The measures of spread we will consider are the range, interquartile range, variance and standard deviation. For these quantities it is useful to distinguish between the population and a sample drawn from the population. 3.4.1 Population mean The population mean is a parameter (usually denoted by \\(\\mu\\)) which is typically unknown. To obtain the population mean we have to sample every object in the population to obtain the true parameter. It is given by \\[\\mu=\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i}{N}\\] where \\(N\\) is the population size \\(x_i\\) is the \\(i\\)th value in the set of values denoted by \\(x\\) (e.g. \\(x_1, x_2, \\ldots ,x_N\\)) 3.4.2 Sample mean Measuring every object in the population is often too difficult/expensive/impossible, therefore a sample is taken from the population and we obtain an estimate of \\(\\mu\\) - this is called the sample mean. Remember, an estimate is a quantity calculated from our sample in order to estimate an unknown parameter. The notation used to denote the sample mean varies; sometimes \\(\\hat{\\mu}\\) is used, where the hat denotes it is an estimate. More frequently, it is denoted by a bar over the name of the variable (e.g. \\(\\bar x\\)). For any given sample, the sample mean is given by \\[\\bar x = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i}{n}\\] where \\(n\\) is the sample size \\(x_i\\) is the \\(i\\)th value in the set of values denoted by \\(x\\) (e.g. \\(x_1, x_2, \\ldots ,x_n\\)) The sample mean for the sample set of values in \\(z\\) will be \\[ \\bar z = \\frac{2+2+2+2+2+3+4+4+5+5+5+6+7+7+8+8+8+8+10+10}{20} = \\frac{108}{20}=5.4\\] 3.4.3 Sample median We find the sample median (sometimes denoted by \\(\\tilde{x}\\)) for any given sample of data by: sorting the values in value order and finding the middle number. The position of the sample median for an ordered set of values can be found using: \\[\\textrm{position}=\\frac{n+1}{2}\\] where \\(n\\) is the sample size. This formula means that when the sample size is an odd number the median can be directly obtained from the data set. For example, if \\(n=11\\), the median lies in the 6th position: \\[\\textrm{position} = \\frac{11+1}2=6 \\] If \\(n\\) is an even number, the median lies between two values. If, for example, \\(n=12\\), then \\(\\textrm{position}=\\frac{12+1}2=6.5\\). Thus, the median will lie between the 6th and 7th values. For simplicity and ease of calculation, the average of the two values is often used. In the sample set of data \\(z\\), there are 20 values, therefore, \\[\\textrm{position}=\\frac{20+1}{2}=10.5\\] and so the median will be the average of the 10th and 11th positions. Our sample is already sorted in order and the values in these positions are 5 and 5, thus, the median is \\(\\frac{5+5}2 = 5\\). 3.4.4 Range One of the simplest summary measures of variability is the range, the difference between the maximum and minimum value. In the sample set of numbers \\(z\\), the lowest is 2 and the highest is 10, and so the range is 10 - 2 = 8. The range is often referred to as the minimum to maximum value (e.g. the range is 2 to 10) but statistically it is the difference of these numbers. Although useful, the range can sometimes be misleading if there is one number very different to the rest. For example, in the set \\((3, 7, 9, 12, 14, 18, 19, 20, 1115)\\), the range is \\(1115 - 3 = 1112\\), however, eight of the numbers are between 3 and 20. Therefore, other measures of spread may be more useful. As an aside, an outlier in a set of data is a value that is very different to the other values recorded, such as the value 1115 in the above set. This value may be due to natural variability or due to an error in recording for example, (e.g. it may really be two numbers 11 and 15). If outliers are identified, they should be double-checked in case of error. The mean is somewhat sensitive to outliers whereas the median is more robust to outliers. 3.4.5 Percentiles The median is also known as the 50th percentile because 50% of values lie below it and 50% of values lie above it and while this value is commonly used as a measure of the centre, other percentile values are commonly used to describe the spread of the data. In particular, 25th percentile (also called the lower or 1st quartile) - the value at which 25% of the data lies below and 75% above, and 75th percentile (upper or 3rd quartile) - the value at which 75% of the data lies below and 25% above. The interquartile range (IQR) is given by (75th percentile - 25th percentile), thus 50% of the data lies in this range. In the sample set \\(z\\), we have 20 values, therefore the 25th percentile lies between the 5th and 6th position (5 values below and 15 values above), thus the average of the values in these positions is \\(\\frac{2+3}2 = 2.5\\). The 75th percentile lies between the 14th and 15th position (15 values below and 5 values above), giving \\(\\frac{8+8}2= 8\\). The IQR is thus \\(8 - 2.5 = 5.5\\). As an aside, when the value of a percentile lies between two numbers, it is convenient, when doing calculations by hand, to calculate the mean of the two numbers. However, different algorithms can be used and in fact R uses such an algorithm by default, which may result in a slightly different answer compared to using the mean; we will see an example of this later. 3.4.6 Population variance To obtain a measure of the variability in the population, we might, intuitively, calculate the difference between each value and the population mean and sum over all values: \\[ \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - \\mu) \\] Using the sample set \\(z\\) as a population, we get \\[(2-5.4) + (2-5.4) + ... + (10-5.4) = -3.4 + (-3.4) + ...+ 4.6 = 0\\] Hmm! This clearly doesnt quantify the variability very well because the result is 0; this is because the mean is the centre of all the values in the set. Squaring the differences avoids this problem: \\[ \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - \\mu)^2 \\] To obtain a measure of the average difference over all values, we divide by \\(N\\). \\[\\sigma^2 = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^N{(x_i - \\mu)^2}}{N} \\] This is called the population variance and is usually denoted by \\(\\sigma^2\\). 3.4.7 Sample variance and standard deviation As with the mean, we are generally dealing with a sample and not the whole population. Therefore, the population mean, \\(\\mu\\), is unknown and so the mean is estimated from a sample of size \\(n\\). Thus, the sample variance (denoted by \\(s^2\\)) is generally a more usual estimate to obtain: \\[s^2 = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n{(x_i - \\bar x)^2}}{n-1} \\] Note the use of \\((n-1)\\) in the denominator instead of \\(n\\). The quantity \\((n-1)\\) is called the degrees of freedom of \\(s^2\\). It can be thought of as a correction for using a sample rather than the population. Returning to our sample set of values \\(z\\), the sample variance will be given by: \\[s^2 = \\frac{(2-5.4)^2 + (2-5.4)^2 + ... + (10-5.4)^2}{20-1}\\] \\[ = \\frac{(-3.4)^2 + (-3.4)^2 + ...+ 4.6^2}{19} = \\frac{142.8}{19} = 7.516\\] The units of variance are tricky because they are units squared; by taking the square root of the variance, the statistic is transformed back to the same scale as the original values. This is called the sample standard deviation, \\(s\\): \\[s = \\sqrt{s^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n{(x_i - \\bar x)^2}}{n-1}} \\] The standard deviation for the sample set is thus: \\[s = \\sqrt{7.516} = 2.741\\] 3.4.8 Numerical summaries in R # Numerical summary commands # As before, use the sample set of data, z z &lt;- c(2,2,2,2,2,3,4,4,5,5,5,6,7,7,8,8,8,8,10,10) # Mean mean(z) [1] 5.4 # Median median(z) [1] 5 # Obtain min and max values for the range - NOTE it doesn&#39;t do the calculation range(z) [1] 2 10 # Obtain percentiles # NOTE, a different algorithm is used to calculate the percentile if it lies # between two numbers quantile(z, probs=0.25) # 25th 25% 2.75 quantile(z, probs=0.75) # 75th 75% 8 # Interquartile range IQR(z) [1] 5.25 # Sample variance var(z) [1] 7.515789 # Sample standard deviation sd(z) [1] 2.741494 Rather than calculating all these values separately, they are a couple of useful functions that combine some of these statistics. # Summary summary(z) Min. 1st Qu.

Q3.2 The following five values have been recorded {19.5, 9.8, 8.6, 11.5, 5.1}. Using these numbers calculate: a. the sample mean, b. median, c. range and d. sample standard deviation. 3.5 Visual summaries The adage a picture paints a thousand words is especially relevant when summarising data. In this section, we highlight some of the basic methods for displaying both discrete and continuous data when considering both single variables and the relationship between two, or even three, variables. 3.5.1 Bar charts Bar charts, or bar plots, are essentially visual representations of frequency distributions. There is a bar for each discrete value and the height of the bar represents the frequency of the value. The bar chart for the example set of data, \\(z\\), is shown in Figure 3.1. Figure 3.1: Vertical bar chart representing the frequency distribution in Table 1. In Figure 3.1, the bars are vertical but they could also be horizontal. The gaps between the bars are a useful reminder that the values are discrete (and we look at histograms where there are no gaps later). 3.5.2 Pie charts Pie charts are another way to view information in a frequency distribution (Figure 3.2). The area (and central angle) of each slice is proportional to the number it represents. Figure 3.2: Pie chart representing the frequency distribution in Table 3.1. There are many variants of the basic pie chart (e.g. exploded pie chart) but, in general, pie charts come with a serious health-warning because they can be difficult to interpret, particularly if there are many possible values. 3.5.3 Histograms Histograms are a simple, effective and useful tool for displaying continuous data. Histograms partition the data values into distinct bins, or intervals, and the height of the bin represents the number of values in each bin. The division of data into different bins can alter the appearance appreciably; computer software generally have algorithms to decide on the bins (Figure 3.3). Figure 3.3: Examples of data that is symmetrical about the mean is represented by two histograms using different bin widths. Histograms show the centre, spread (variability) and skewness in the data. Skewness is a measure of asymmetry about the mean and this feature is swiftly evident from histograms. In Figure 3.3, 100 values are represented and the mean of the values is 20. We can see that the plot is roughly symmetric about the mean and so the skewness value is low. The median is the point where 50% of the area of the histogram lies to the left and 50% lies to the right. In this figure, the median is 20 - the mean and median are the same. This is always the case if the shape of the histogram is symmetric. In fact, comparing the mean and median gives an indication of the skewness of data (Figure 3.4): Right, or positively, skewed data has a relatively long right tail compared to the left and the mean is greater than the median Left, or negatively, skewed data has a relatively long left tail compared to the right and the mean is less than the median. For symmetric data, the mean and median are equal. Figure 3.4: Histograms of left-skewed data and right-skewed data. The red dashed line indicates the mean and the blue dotted indicates the median. For highly skewed data the median is often a more appropriate measure of the centre than the mean, for example, salary or house prices. A histogram is useful because it shows the sampled frequency of different ranges of values. If there is no discernible peak (or peaks) and all values are similarly likely, the distribution is described as uniform (Figure 3.5). Figure 3.5: A histogram showing 500 values selected at random from the set [0, 1]. 3.5.4 Boxplots An alternative to the histogram is the box plot (or box-and-whisker plot). These plots convey summary numerical information in the plot (Figure 3.6) Figure 3.6: Box plot of 100 values of variable called \\(x\\). See below for an explanation of the numbers in blue. The following numerical information can be gleaned from the plot (which was obtained in R using the default values): the median of the data is represented by the thick black line across the box (1 on Figure 3.6), the lower limit of the box is the 25th percentile (2), the upper limit of the box is the 75th percentile (3), the height of the box spans the IQR, the whiskers extend to the most extreme values, as long as these values are no more than 1.5 \\(\\times\\) the IQR from the box (this can be changed in R), if there are any values beyond the whiskers (as there are in Figure 3.6), they are plotted as dots and highlighted as potentially unusual points (4 and 5). 3.5.5 Basic plots in R To create examples of the above plots in R, first some data is generated - stored in an object called \\(x\\). Dont worry at present about the command used to create the data - this will be addressed later in the course. # Set seed for RNG set.seed(1234) # Generate 100 random values from a symmetric (normal) distribution with # mean=20 and standard deviation=3 x &lt;- rnorm(n=100, mean=20, sd=3) # Boxplot boxplot(x) # Histogram hist(x) # Create more bins (note the number of bins may not be exactly that specified) hist(x, nclass=10, main=&quot;Histogram of x with more bins&quot;) # Use specific bin intervals bins &lt;- seq(from=10, to=30, by=2) bins [1] 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30 hist(x, breaks=bins) 3.5.6 Other plots Histograms and box plots are classical plots but more sophisticated plots have been developed more recently which can be used as alternatives, such as the violin plot and rain cloud plots. Both combine box plots and a smoothed histogram. 3.6 Summarising the relationship between two variables The plots and numerical summaries described so far have been concerned with a single variable. Frequently, we want to look at the relationship between two variables. In many situations one variable (conventionally denoted by \\(X\\)), will be considered as an explanatory (or independent) variable, while the other variable (conventionally denoted by \\(Y\\)), is deemed to be the response (or dependent) variable. The methods used to summarise (and analyse) these data depend on the types of data (see Table 3.2 for some examples). Table 3.2: Examples of the relationship between different types of data. X Y X.type Y.type Amount of fertilizer Weight of Crop Quantitative Quantitative Gender Salary Qualitative Quantitative Socio/economic class Type of employment Qualitative Qualitative 3.6.1 Cross-tabulation If both variables are qualitative, or discrete with a small number of possible values, then a cross-tabulation (also known as a contingency table) could be used - this is essentially an extension of the frequency distribution seen previously. Table 3.3 is an example of a cross-tabulation which summarises the number of people using one of three diets by gender. Table 3.3: Number of subjects by diet and gender. 1 2 3 Female 14 14 15 Male 10 11 12 Unknown 0 2 0 3.6.1.1 Doing this in R # Example of a cross-tabulation # Create some data - specify sample size n &lt;- 10 # Generate values at random var1 &lt;- sample(1:5, size=n, replace=TRUE) var2 &lt;- sample(c(&quot;Y&quot;,&quot;N&quot;), size=n, replace=TRUE) # Print data var1 [1] 3 3 5 1 4 4 3 2 1 1 var2 [1] &quot;Y&quot; &quot;N&quot; &quot;Y&quot; &quot;Y&quot; &quot;Y&quot; &quot;N&quot; &quot;N&quot; &quot;N&quot; &quot;Y&quot; &quot;Y&quot; # Cross tabulation of data table(var1, var2) var2 var1 N Y 1 0 3 2 1 0 3 2 1 4 1 1 5 0 1 3.6.2 Side-by-side boxplots If one variable is discrete and one continuous, then the continuous data could be divided into the groups specified by the qualitative (or discrete) variable: a numerical summary and box plot can be created for each group. For example in Figure 3.7, the initial weights of people using one of three diets are illustrated. Figure 3.7: Example of side-by-side boxplots to display the relationship between a quantitative and a qualitative variable. Histograms could also be used in a similar way - see the computer practical associated with this chapter. 3.6.3 Scatter plot The scatter plot is frequently used to display the relationship between two continuous variables. The values for each pair of variables are plotted on a graph with the response on the \\(y\\)-axis and the explanatory variable on the \\(x\\)-axis (Figure 3.8). Figure 3.8: Scatter plot showing the relationship between the height and weight of subjects before starting a diet. If there was a third, discrete variable, then different colours, or symbols, could be used to highlight the points for the different levels. For example, in Figure 3.9 the different coloured and shaped symbols represent the diet. Figure 3.9: Scatter plot of the height and weight of subjects indicating diet group. The initial weights seem to be fairly similar across each group (see point below). The range of heights in each group is approximately 45cm but for diet groups 1 and 2, the minimum and maximum heights are 155 and 200cm approximately, whereas in the diet 3 group, the minimum and maximum are 141 and 185cm approx. There are two observations that are potentially unusual; one height is substantially smaller that other heights (approx. 141 cm) and one weight is substantially larger that other weights (approx. 103 kg). 3.6.3.1 Doing this in R To illustrate how to create a scatter plot in R, we first need to create some data. Dont worry too much about the commands used to create the data - these will be explained further as we go through the course. The more important commands for this section are the plot commands. # Generate 50 random values between 10 and 50 num &lt;- 50 xdata &lt;- runif(n=num, min=10, max=50) # Generate 50 random values from a normal distribution (mean=x and sd=5) ydata &lt;- rnorm(n=num, mean=xdata, sd=3) # Scatter plot plot(x=xdata, y=ydata) There are many options available in the plot functions to customise the plot, for example, different plotting symbols and colours. Use the help facility in R to look at the options available. 3.6.4 Quilt plots If we are interested in the relationship between three continuous variables, a quilt plot can be used (an application can be found here here). These are a particularly useful way to summarise geo-referenced data (e.g. where variables \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) represent spatial coordinates and a third variable \\(z\\) may represent altitude, for example). Q3.3 A doctor is investigating the effects of exercise on arthritis in human subjects aged 60 years. One hundred arthritis sufferers and 100 people who do not suffer from arthritis are asked to estimate how many hours of exercise they have taken each week, on average, over the past 5 years. The distribution of the average number of hours of exercise taken per week per person (called \\(X\\)) for both groups is shown in the histogram below. Based on the figure which statement is certainly FALSE (pick one statement only). A The minimum value of the data is 2 and the maximum value is 50 hours. B The first, or lower, quartile lies in the range 0 to 10. C The median lies in the range 20 to 30. D The mean is 21.1 hours. Q3.4 a. The following numbers were generated with the function fivenum. What are the range and IQR? [1] 8.271511 15.028300 17.323850 19.924308 32.079176 b. A box plot was also provided and shown below. How can you tell that the box plot and five number summary are not describing exactly the same observations? Q3.5 What is the difference between a bar chart and a histogram? Q3.6 Consider the following summary of a continuous variable obtained using the summary function in R. What can you tell about the distribution of this variable? Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. 0.04794 0.48459 0.86375 1.04466 1.38397 5.08813 Q3.7 What method would be useful to assess the relationship between the following two variables: Ethnicity and type of employment (e.g. retail, agricultural, medical). Volume of rainfall (litres) and the amount of runoff on an airport runway (litres). Temperature (\\(^o\\)C) and habitat type (e.g. Farmland, woodland). 3.7 Handy hints when including tables and plots into reports When including tables and plots into reports it is useful to keep a few rules in mind so that they are easy to understand and interpret and illustrate the key points. Figures Make the plots self-explanatory: provide a title or label, label the axes and clearly state the units, provide a key if required. Choose a scale that is convenient and makes the most of the paper/plotting region (i.e. does not have too much white-space) Include the origin, or if it is not included take care not to mislead. Consider whether the information may be more easily understood in a table, maybe in addition to any plots. Tables Make the table clear and simple with the main numbers for comparison close to each other. Arrange rows and columns in some natural order. Choose convenient units and state what they are. Provide a title and brief explanation of the data displayed. If the table is getting complicated, consider splitting a table into smaller tables. Round the numbers to an appropriate number of digits for presentation, for example two effective digits (e.g. 129, 1.2) but not for calculation. Example Consider Table 3.4 showing the numbers of people aged 16 and over in Wales in 2001 by marital status. Table 3.4: Number of people in each marital status group. Status Number Single (never married) 649512 Married 1031511 Remarried 172466 Separated (but legally married) 43819 Divorced 200991 Widowed 217631 Total 2315930 For presentation, the table has been rearranged so that the rows are in order of size of group with the largest group at the top. The percentages have been added for ease of comparison (Table 3.5. Table 3.5: Number and percentage by marital status. Status Number (1000s) Percentage Married 1032 44.5 Single (never married) 650 28.0 Widowed 218 9.4 Divorced 201 8.7 Remarried 172 7.4 Separated (but legally married) 44 1.9 Total 2316 100.0 3.8 Summary Numerical summaries provide: a measure of the centre of the distribution (mean, median, mode), a measure of the spread (range, IQR, standard deviation). Histograms and box plots show overall features in the data such as the: mode, symmetry or asymmetry, and outliers. Scatter plots show any relationships between the two variables if there is a relationship, whether the relationship is linear or not, and outliers. 3.8.1 Learning outcomes You should be able to: recognise different types of data calculate a numerical summery of the centre and spread for a set of data choose an appropriate plot and understand the features of the different plots. 3.9 Answers Q3.1 The five numbers produced by the fivenum function are minimum, 25th percentile, median, 75th percentile and maximum (in that order). Note, the difference in the percentile measurements between fivenum and summary functions; summary uses a different algorithm to calculate the percentiles. The help for fivenum refers to a lower-hinge and an upper-hinge, these are the 25th and 75th percentiles, respectively. Q3.2 a. The mean is given by \\[ \\bar x = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} {x_i}}n=\\frac{19.5 + 9.8 + 8.6 + 11.5 + 5.1}5 = \\frac{54.4}5 = 10.9 \\] Q3.2 b. To calculate the median, we need to first sort the data in numerical order; {5.1, 8.6, 9.8, 11.5, 19.5}. The median is the value at\\(\\textrm{position} =\\frac{5+1}2 = 3\\). The value in the 3rd position is 9.8, hence, this is the median. Q3.2 c. The range is given by the maximum - minimum value which is \\(19.5 - 5.1 = 14.1\\). Q3.2 d. The sample standard deviation is given by: \\[s = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n{(x_i - \\bar x)^2}}{n-1}} \\] \\[s = \\sqrt{\\frac{(5.1-10.9)^2 + (8.6-10.9)^2 + (9.8-10.9)^2 + (11.5-10.9)^2 + (19.5-10.9)^2}{5-1}}\\] \\[ = \\sqrt{\\frac{73.96 + 1.21 + 5.29 + 0.36 + 33.64}{4}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{114.46}4} = \\sqrt{28.615} = 5.349 \\] Q3.3 Statement A could be TRUE - the histogram does not explicitly indicate the minimum and maximum values, just that the minimum value is between 0 to 5 and the maximum is between 45 to 50. Statement B is TRUE - For 200 observations the lower, or 25th, quartile will lie between the 50th and 51st value. Adding up the number of observations in the range 0 to 10, gives about 57 observations, hence, the lower quartile will lie in this range. Statement C is FALSE - there are 200 observations (100 arthritis sufferers and 100 non-sufferers) and so the median is average of 100th and 101st value and adding up the number of observations in bins up to 20 hours will be more than 100 observations and so the median cannot lie in the range 20 to 30 hours. Statement D could be TRUE - with a distribution like this is it is difficult to tell what the mean value will be without calculating it but 21.5 looks like a good guess. A rough calculation would be to use the number of observations in each bin (\\(n_i\\)) (obtained from the histogram) and the mid point of each bin (\\(m_i\\)) as follows (where \\(B\\) is the number of bins): \\[\\bar x = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^B n_i \\times m_i}{200} \\] \\[ = \\frac{(5 \\times 2.5) + (52 \\times 7.5) + (45 \\times 12.5) + ... + (12 \\times 47.5)}{200} = 21.13\\] Dont forget that there were 200 values and so \\[\\sum_{i=1}^B n_i = 200 \\] Q3.4 a. From the five number summary, the range is given by 32.0791759 \\(-\\) 8.2715115 = 23.8076644. The IQR is given by 19.9243085 \\(-\\) 15.0282996 = 4.8960089. Q3.4 b. There are various measures that indicate differences between the plot and the summary: The minimum and maximum values are different. The 25th and 75th percentiles from the five number summary are 15.0282996 and 19.9243085 and from the box plot are18.0113198 and 19.9697234. Q3.5 A histogram is used to display quantitative data and has a range of numeric values on the \\(x\\)-axis, whereas a bar chart is used to display qualitative data (or discrete data with a few possible values) and has distinct categories on the \\(x\\)-axis. Q3.6 From the numerical summary, we can see that the minimum value is 0 and the maximum value is 5. The median (0.864 is less than the mean (1.04) and so the data are right-skewed (i.e. with a long tail to the right). This is clearly seen looking at a histogram and box plot of the data, shown below. Q3.7 The methods useful for assessing the relationship between pairs of variables depends on the type of data. In the examples below, there are a mix of quantitative and qualitative variables. Q3.7 a. Ethnicity and type of employment (e.g. retail, agricultural, medical). Both variables are qualitative and so a frequency table showing the numbers in each category would be created. From the frequency table, the percentages in each category can be obtained. Q3.7 b. Volume of rainfall (litres) and the amount of runoff on an airport runway (litres). Both these variables are continuous and so a scatterplot would illustrate the relationship between them. Q3.7 c. Temperature (\\(^o\\)C) and habitat type (e.g. Farmland, woodland). Temperature is a continuous variable and habitat type is qualitative and so side-by-side boxplots, or a series of histograms (one histogram of temperature for each habitat type), could be used to display the relationship.

Oxford English Dictionary (1989) Here we define probability, consider how to represent it mathematically, present some axioms and basic results, and work through some example probability calculations. By the end of the this chapter, you should be able to: distinguish the different definitions of probability understand the basic axioms of probability be aware of Bayes theorem. In 2006, the polling organisation, Populus Limited, randomly sampled 1,509 adults, age 18 and older, by telephone between January 6\\(^{th}\\) and 8\\(^{th}\\) and asked each adult their voting intention (Labour, Conservative, Liberal Democrat, and Other). The resulting percentages were: Table 4.1: Voting intention in Populus survey. Party Percentage Labour 39 Conservative 36 Liberal Democrat 16 Other 9 How close are these sample statistics to the population parameters? A different sample would have got a different answer, so there must be uncertainty associated with these sample statistics. Sampled value = Parameter + Chance Error i.e. signal + noise The parameter(s) in this case are the unknown population proportions. So what is the magnitude of the error? Ideas from probability will help with this. Throughout statistics, we consider the evaluation of hypotheses where we attach a probability to a particular event given a particular set of results. This allows us to decide whether to accept or reject the hypotheses. Therefore, this chapter will consider the concept of probability in some detail. 4.1.1 Random phenomena and uncertain outcomes Lots of processes present us with uncertainty - consider processes that are random, repeatable and uncertain. For example Process: Toss a coin Outcomes: Head, Tail, Side Process: A person who does not have HIV is tested for HIV Outcomes: Negative test result, Positive test result (a false positive) Process: Departure time of a flight from Edinburgh to London on an airline. Outcomes: the flight departs on time, 1 minute late, 2 minutes late, etc Probability is a branch of mathematics that deals with the quantification of uncertainty. A few things to remember about probabilities: Probabilities must lie between 0 and 1 (and cannot be larger than one or less than zero) Probabilities are sometimes expressed as percentages, e.g. 0 = 0%, 0.2 = 20%, 0.02 = 2% 4.2 Sample spaces and events There are a lot of terms (explained below) related to the possible outcomes of a random process: sample space, elementary events, compound events, mutually exclusive events, independent events. 1. The collection of all possible outcomes of an experiment is the sample space, and is denoted \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) (or as in Figure 4.1. \\(\\Omega\\)). Examples of sample spaces: Toss Coin: \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) = {H,T} (Note the use of curly brackets to indicate a set.). We will assume from here on, that the chance of a coin falling on its side is so negligible that it can be ignored. HIV Test: \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) = {Negative, Positive} Airplane actual departure time - scheduled departure time: \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) = {0 to 360 minutes} assuming the flight is cancelled after 3 hours. 2. A subset of outcomes in \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) is called an Event and its often labelled by a capital letter, e.g. \\(A\\). Let \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) be any two events defined on a particular sample space. For example The set of all possible outcomes occurring: \\(A\\) alone, \\(B\\) alone, or in either \\(A\\) and \\(B\\).. union of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), \\(A \\cup B\\) or \\(A ~\\mbox{or}~ B\\) (Figure 4.1). Figure 4.1: A Venn diagram of the union of events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). The set of all events in \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) that do not occur in \\(A\\) is: complement of \\(A\\) or \\(\\overline{A}\\) or \\(A^c\\). When \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) have no outcomes in common, they are mutually exclusive or disjoint, i.e., \\(A \\cap B\\) = \\(\\emptyset\\). \\(\\emptyset\\) means empty set. If there is just one outcome in an event \\(A\\), the event is called simple or elementary, otherwise it is called compound. When \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) have no outcomes in common, they are mutually exclusive or disjoint, i.e., \\(A \\cap B\\) = \\(\\emptyset\\) The set of all outcomes occurring only in both \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) is intersection of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), \\(A \\cap B\\), or \\(A ~\\mbox{and}~ B\\) (Figure 4.2). Figure 4.2: A Venn diagram of the intercept of events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). The set of all events in S that do not occur in \\(A\\) is the complement of \\(A\\) or \\(\\overline{A}\\) or \\(A^c\\). So if the probability of sighting the Loch Ness Monster in a day at Loch Ness is 0.3 (e.g. \\(Pr(Nessie)=0.3\\)) then the probability we dont see anything would be \\(Pr(\\overline{Nessie})=1-0.3=0.7\\). This is called the law of complementary probability. Example Roll 2 dice and count the total number of dots face up. Define two events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) as follows: \\(A\\) = get an even number \\(B\\) = get a number that is divisible by 3 Thus \\(A\\) = ({2}, {4}, {6}, {8}, {10}, {12}). and \\(B\\) = ({3}, {6}, {9}, {12}). Then \\(A \\cup B\\) = {2,3,4,6,8,9,10,12} \\(A \\cap B\\) = {6,12} \\(A^c\\) = {3,5,7,9,11} Are \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) disjoint? No. \\(A \\cap B \\ne \\emptyset\\). This example contain stochasticity - a particular realisation of the process isnt completely predictable. The usual way of treating this is probabilistically. 4.3 Definition of Probability and 3 Axioms 4.3.1 Probability Informally: Consider a process, with multiple uncertain outcomes, that could be repeated infinitely often, in an identical and independent fashion, then the probability of an event \\(A\\), \\(\\Pr(A)\\), is the long run relative frequency of \\(A\\). How does the above definition compare to probability in the following contexts? Q4.1 The probability I win on a European roulette wheel choosing 1 number? Q4.2 The probability that I win any money on a spin of an mechanical one-armed bandit? Q4.3 The probability that the All Blacks win the 2019 world cup? Q4.4 The probability of rain tomorrow in St Andrews 10-11am is 0.07 (7% chance)? Q4.5 The probability of nuclear war breaking out tomorrow? 4.3.2 Three Axioms Formally probability can be described by 3 axioms. (Axiom 1) The probability of an event \\(A \\in \\mathcal{S}\\), denoted \\(\\Pr(A)\\) is a number between 0 and 1, inclusive. (Axiom 2) \\(\\Pr(\\mathcal{S})\\) = 1 (Axiom 3) If \\(A_1\\), \\(A_2\\), \\(\\ldots\\), \\(A_k\\) are a finite collection of mutually exclusive events, then \\[ \\Pr(A_1 \\cup A_2 \\cup \\ldots \\cup A_k) = \\sum_{i=1}^k \\Pr(A_i) \\] Informally, this is called the Addition Rule and applies if \\(k\\) is infinite too. These mean practically: Things that never happen get probability value 0. Things that are certain get probability value 1. Uncertain things get quantified between 0 and 1. We need to know all possible outcomes to assign probabilities. You can add probabilities of mutually exclusive things to get the probability one of them happens. Example The outcomes of a single die roll are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. The probability of getting any number at all is one from the second axiom. What is the probability of getting an even number? \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\Pr(2 \\cup 4 \\cup 6) &amp;= \\Pr(2) + \\Pr(4) + \\Pr(6)\\\\ &amp;= \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \\end{aligned} \\] This uses Axiom 3 since \\(2\\), \\(4\\), and \\(6\\) are mutually exclusive. 4.3.3 Three results of the Axioms All the other rules of probability come from these axioms Complement rule: \\(\\Pr(A^c) = 1 - \\Pr(A)\\). General addition rule. \\(\\Pr(A \\cup B) = \\Pr(A) + \\Pr(B) - \\Pr(A \\cap B)\\). We have to subtract \\(\\Pr(A \\cap B)\\) otherwise we would be counting that event space twice. Therefore, we adjust the sum of the two probabilities by subtracting the probability of the two events occurring together.This is called the general addition rule. Intersection of 2 mutually exclusive events: If \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are mutually exclusive, then \\(\\Pr(A \\cap B) = 0\\) (i.e. they cannot occur together) and the addition formula reduces to: \\[Pr(A \\cup B) = Pr(A) + Pr(B)\\] Remember to think of \\(\\cap\\) as AND and \\(\\cup\\) as OR 4.4 Independence and the Multiplication Rule Formally, if two events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are independent, then \\[\\Pr(A \\cap B) = \\Pr(A) \\times \\Pr(B)\\] Thus when two events are independent, the probability of both happening is the product of the two individual probabilities. In plain language this means the occurrence of one event does not affect the probability of the other occurring. Independence makes probability calculations easy - it is often assumed (but often not true) 4.4.1 Testing for Independence We can assess if events F and G are actually independent using the multiplication rule where we ask if \\(Pr(A) \\times Pr(B)=Pr(A \\cap B)\\) Example A fair coin will be tossed twice. Let \\(A\\) be the event of a Head on the first toss and \\(B\\) be the event of a Tail on the second toss. The outcomes for two different flips should be independent (since the coin has no memory). Thus, \\(\\Pr(A \\cap B)\\) = \\(\\Pr(A) \\times \\Pr(B)\\) = 0.5 \\(\\times\\) 0.5 = 0.25. This could be tested by tossing the coin numerous times and seeing if the long run frequency matched 0.25. Q4.6 In an ordinary card deck there are 52 cards: 4 suits (diamonds, hearts, clubs, spades) of 13 cards (Ace,2,3,\\(\\ldots\\),10,J,Q,K). A deck is shuffled and one card is drawn and removed, and a second card is drawn. Let \\(A\\) = first card = 2 of Spades and \\(B\\)=second card is 3 of spades. What is \\(\\Pr(A \\cap B)\\)? 4.5 Conditional probabilities If there is partial information about the result of a random process, that information can be used to calculate conditional probabilities for particular events. Conditional probabilities are often the most interesting (and counter intuitive!) aspects of probability-based work. Consider two events \\(S\\) and \\(D\\) \\(S\\) = the event that one or more animals were seen in a sampling location and \\(D\\) = a randomly chosen sampling location was in a desert. We are now interested in the probability of \\(S\\) occurring given that \\(D\\) has occurred. What is the probability of seeing an animal if you are are looking in a desert? This probability is written as \\(Pr (S|D)\\), and is called the conditional probability of \\(S\\) given \\(D\\): \\[Pr(S|D) = \\frac{Pr(S \\cap D)}{Pr(D)}\\] This equation can be rewritten as a well-known theorem. First rearrange the above equation, such that \\(Pr(S \\cap D) = Pr(S|D)P(D)\\). We know that \\(Pr(S \\cap D) = Pr(D \\cap S)\\) and so \\(Pr(D \\cap S) = Pr(D|S)P(S)\\) (if \\(Pr(S) \\ne 0\\)). Hence, \\[Pr(S|D) = \\frac{Pr(D|S)P(S)}{Pr(D)}\\] This equation is named after an 18th century mathematician, Reverend Thomas Bayes, and known as Bayes theorem. This probability expresses a degree of belief in an event, where the degree of belief may be based on prior knowledge about the event; prior knowledge may be gained from the results of previous experiments, for example. Bayesian statistics is a branch of statistics in which methods use Bayes theorem to calculate and update probabilities based on new data, or information. For more information see here. If \\(S\\) and \\(D\\) are independent then whether \\(D\\) occurred or not will not affect \\(Pr(S)\\), so that \\(Pr(S|D) = Pr(S)\\). Consider two events A and B A = the event that a head is tossed B = the event that a tail is tossed In this case coin tosses are independent Substituting this into the rule of conditional probability gives \\[Pr(A|B) = Pr(A) = \\frac{Pr(A \\cap B)} {Pr(B)}\\] and rearranging gives you the multiplication rule (see above). \\[ Pr(A) \\times Pr(B) = Pr(A \\cap B) \\] Explanation by example. This example is taken from Moore (1992). A cross tabulation of suicides classified by victim and whether or not a firearm was used: Male Female Total Firearm 16,381 2,559 18,940 Other 9,034 3,536 12,570 Total 25,415 6,095 31,510 We convert the table into a relative frequency table with 4 categories by dividing throughout by the grand total 31,510, e.g. the total proportion of males is \\(25415/31510 = 0.807\\): Male Female Total Firearm 0.520 0.081 0.601 Other 0.287 0.112 0.399 Total 0.807 0.193 1.000 Let \\(G\\) be the event that a firearm was used then \\(\\Pr(G)\\) = 0.601. If \\(F\\) is the event that a victim is female then \\(\\Pr(F)\\) = 0.193. If you know the victim was Female (i.e. Given Female), what is the probability a firearm was used? We can use Bayes theorem - we need the values from the table that represent the probability that the victim was Female and used a firearm (0.081) and the probability the victim was Female (0.193): \\[Pr(G|F) = \\frac{Pr(G \\cap F)} {Pr(F)} = \\frac{0.081}{0.193} = 0.420\\] Therefore the probability of a firearm being used given it was a women is an example of conditional probability. 4.5.1 Independence revisited One definition of independence is that two events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are independent when \\(\\Pr(A|B)\\)=\\(\\Pr(A)\\), or equivalently \\(\\Pr(B|A)\\)=\\(\\Pr(B)\\). In words, knowing that \\(B\\) occurred tells one nothing about the probability of \\(A\\). The general multiplication rule reduces to ``the multiplication rule: \\[ \\Pr(A \\cap B) = \\Pr(A|B) \\times \\Pr(B) = \\Pr(A) \\times \\Pr(B) \\] 4.6 Tree Diagrams A sometimes useful technique for calculating probabilities when there is a sequence of random processes is to draw a tree diagram. A tree diagram is a device used to enumerate all possible outcomes of a sequence of procedures, where the number of possible outcomes for each procedure is finite (paraphrasing Lipshutz (2011)). This approach can be used as a simple way of considering problems that might involve complex probabilities. Example Let us suppose that the probability a woman aged 40 has breast cancer is 1%. If a woman has breast cancer, the probability she tests positive on a screening mammogram is 99%. If she does not have breast cancer the probability that she nonetheless tests positive is 9%. What are the chances that a woman who tests positive actually has breast cancer? Considered as a conditional probability problem it is complex. We know: \\(Pr(Cancer)\\) = 0.01 \\(Pr(positive|Cancer)\\) = 0.99 \\(Pr(positive|Not cancer)\\) = 0.09 So the question is what is Pr(Cancer|positive)? This can be calculated as \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\Pr(Cancer|positive) = \\frac{\\Pr(Cancer \\cap positive)}{\\Pr(positive)} \\end{eqnarray*}\\] But it is not immediately obvious what \\(\\Pr(Cancer \\cap positive)\\) and \\(\\Pr(positive)\\) actually are. Considering this as a tree diagram things (Figure 4.3) become a little more obvious. Figure 4.3: All possible outcomes for 100 women. Of 100 women, 1 has cancer and tests positive, 99 do not have cancer of whom 9 will test positive. It now becomes easy to see that the \\(Pr(Cancer|positive)\\) = 1/(1+9) = 0.1 (i.e. 10%) See Gigerenzer (2003) for more on this. Example (adapted from Lipshutz &amp; Lipson 2011): Dragos and Christopher play a tennis tournament. The first person to win 2 games in a row or who wins a total of three games wins the tournament. On average Dragos has a 0.6 probability of winning an individual match and Christopher a 0.4 probability of winning an individual match. What is the probability Dragos wins the tournament. We can tackle something simple like this by complete enumeration of outcomes. The following concepts are needed: independence (winning a game does not alter the chance of a future win of a game) and mutual exclusivity (only one player can win a match). Figure 4.4: Tree for match outcomes. The probability of Dragos winning is \\[0.6 \\times 0.6 + 0.6 \\times 0.4 \\times 0.6 \\times 0.6 + 0.6 \\times 0.4 \\times 0.6 \\times 0.4 \\times 0.6 + 0.4 \\times 0.6 \\times 0.6 +0.4 \\times 0.6 \\times 0.4 \\times 0.6 \\times 0.6\\] \\[= 0.360 + 0.086 + 0.035 + 0.144 +0.035 = 0.660\\] Some lessons arising for later: How would I establish the baseline probabilities of each player winning a match? In reality, what confidence is associated with my assessment? What influences this? 4.7 Marginal and joint probabilities When considering data that can be classified in a variety of ways it is often useful to consider the probabilities that can be generated from such data. When considering just one factor then the probabilities are marginal (for reasons that will become clear in a moment). If two or more factors are considered then the derived probabilities are joint. For example, passengers of the Titanic can be viewed in terms of two ``random processes, living or dying after the ship hit the iceberg, and what class ticket they purchased. There were 2,201 people on the Titanic and the numbers cross-classified by two categories are: Fate First Second Third Crew Total Lived 203 118 178 212 711 Died 122 167 528 673 1490 Total 325 285 706 885 2201 Dividing the cell values, and row and column totals, by the grand total yields a matrix of probabilities. Fate First Second Third Crew Total Lived 0.092 0.054 0.081 0.096 0.323 Died 0.056 0.076 0.240 0.306 0.677 Total 0.148 0.129 0.321 0.402 1.000 For example, \\(\\Pr(Live \\cap Second)\\)=0.054, a joint probability, the proportion of the total of people on board the Titanic who were second class passengers and survived. And \\(\\Pr(Live)\\)=0.323, a marginal probability, the total proportion of people on board who lived. It is marginal because it is calculated from the margins of the table. Of further interest are particular conditional probabilities, such as did the ticket class have an effect on the probability of living? These are conditional probabilities. For example, given that one had a First class ticket, what was the probability of surviving? Substituting this into the rule of conditional probability gives \\[Pr(Lived|First) = \\frac{Pr(Lived \\cap First)} {Pr(First)} = \\frac{0.092} {0.148} = 0.622\\] So \\(Pr(Lived|First)\\) is conditional. \\(Pr(Lived \\cap First)\\) is joint. \\(Pr(First)\\) is marginal. 4.8 Summary Understanding the basics of probability is extremely useful in interpreting evidence and in applying the tests and models that come later in the module. If you want to learn more about the philosophical aspects of probability then consider taking the module Statistical Thinking. 4.8.1 Learning outcomes You should now be able to: distinguish the different definitions of probability understand the basic axioms of probability. seen Bayes theorem and simple applications. 4.9 Answers Q4.1 A European roulette wheel has 37 slots. So the chance of winning on a single number is 1/37. This could be determined as a long run frequency. Q4.2 To determine the exact probability one would need to know the number of wheels, the numerical breakdown of images on each wheel and knowledge of which combinations of images earn a payout. A more practical statistic is the expected return per pound for example. Understandably fruit machine producers are reluctant to supply this information unless compelled by law. This could be determined from a long run frequency. Q4.3 We can never know precisely the probability of a sports team winning a cup as there are so many variables. We might use historical sports statistics to generate a probability based on the performance of similar teams in the past. It would be difficult to determine this as a long run frequency as no teams will remain constant. Q4.4The probability of rain tomorrow could be estimated by a mechanistic physical model which considers the weather conditions based on physical principles. Alternatively the probability of rain could be estimated statistically based on past similar weather conditions. Hence a long run frequency could be considered. Q4.5 Here it is rather difficult to predict the probabilities from observed events. The given probability comes from belief. Q4.6 There are 4 x 13 = 52 cards. Thus the probability of obtaining the first card, \\(Pr(A)\\), is \\(1/52\\). \\(Pr(A)\\) and \\(Pr(B)\\) are not independent and so the probability of obtaining the second card given that one card has already been taken is \\(Pr(B|A) = 1/51\\). Therefore, \\(Pr(A \\cap B) = Pr(A) * Pr(B | A) = \\frac{1}{52} \\times \\frac{1}{51} = \\frac{1}{2652}\\) References "],["discreterv.html", "Chapter 5 Discrete random variables 5.1 Introduction 5.2 Discrete random variables 5.3 Special discrete distributions 5.4 Summary 5.5 Answers", " Chapter 5 Discrete random variables [Professor Moriarty] is a man of good birth and excellent education, endowed by nature with a phenomenal mathematical faculty. At the age of twenty-one, he wrote a treatise upon the binomial theorem, which has had a European vogue. On the strength of it he won the mathematical chair at one of our smaller universities, and had, to all appearances, a most brilliant career before him. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (1894) 5.1 Introduction A random variable is a quantity that can take a range of values that cannot be predicted with certainty but only described probabilistically (Borowski and Borwein (1989)). The values can either be discrete or continuous. In this unit, discrete random values are considered; continuous random values are considered in the following chapter. In this unit, we define: discrete random variables, probability mass functions, cumulative distribution functions expected values and expected variation of discrete random variables, and three specific and useful random variables, Bernoulli, binomial and Poisson random variables. Note that this chapter contains a lot of notation and many equations; please refer to the notation guide. 5.2 Discrete random variables A discrete random variable is random variable which can only take a countable number of values. As an example, consider tossing a fair coin twice; the possible outcomes are head-head, head-tail, tail-head and tail-tail. Assume that the variable of interest is the number of heads (denoted by \\(Y\\)) and so the resulting values, or sample space, for \\(Y\\) are either 0, 1 or 2 heads (Table 5.1). Table 5.1: The possible outcomes (H=head, T=tail) for tossing a coin twice and the resulting combinations of heads (\\(Y\\)). Outcome HH HT TH TT Y 2 1 1 0 The variable \\(Y\\) is a discrete random variable; the outcome can only be a discrete value and we cannot predict the outcome with certainty but we can describe the outcome probabilistically. 5.2.1 Probability mass function The probability mass function (PMF) is simply a mathematical description of the probabilities of outcomes in the sample space. We can construct the PMF for \\(Y\\), the number of heads when tossing a coin twice by considering the possible outcomes (Table 5.1). The sample space is either no heads, one head or two heads (i.e. \\(S\\)={0, 1, 2}). The probability of two heads, written \\(Pr(Y=2)\\), will be 1 out of 4 possible outcomes, thus \\(Pr(Y=2)=0.25\\). Similar calculations can be used to obtain the probability of no heads and one head (Table 5.2). Table 5.2: Probability mass function for \\(Y\\), the number of heads when a coin is tossed twice. y 0 1 2 Pr(Y=y) 0.25 0.5 0.25 The PMF tells us everything about the random variable \\(Y\\). It also has a special property in that if we sum \\(Pr(Y=y)\\) over all possible values in the sample space, we get 1. If the sample space of a random variable denoted by \\(X\\) can be written as {\\({k, k+1, ... , n}\\)} then \\[\\begin{align} \\sum_{x=k}^{n} Pr(X=x) = Pr(X=k) + Pr(X=k+1) + ... + Pr(X=n) = 1 \\end{align}\\] This property is easy to verify for the PMF of \\(Y\\), the number of heads: \\[\\sum_{y=0}^{2} Pr(Y=y) = Pr(Y=0) + Pr(Y=1) + Pr(Y=2) = 0.25 + 0.5 + 0.25 = 1\\] Q5.1 Let event \\(Y\\) be the sum of the numbers resulting from throwing two fair, six-sided die. Calculate the probability mass function of \\(Y\\). 5.2.2 Cumulative distribution function The cumulative distribution function (CDF) is derived from the PMF. For a discrete random variable called \\(X\\), the CDF provides the probability that \\(Pr(X \\le x)\\). Thus, for the coin tossing example, the probability that \\(Y\\) is less than or equal to one head (i.e. \\(Pr(Y \\le 1)\\)) is given by: \\[Pr(Y \\le 1) = Pr(Y=0) + Pr(Y=1) = 0.25 + 0.5 = 0.75\\] A similar calculation can be performed for all values in the sample space (Table 5.3). Table 5.3: Probability mass function (\\(Pr(Y=y)\\)) and cumulative distribution function (\\(Pr(Y \\le y)\\)) for \\(Y\\), the number of heads when a coin is tossed twice. y 0 1 2 Pr(Y=y) 0.25 0.5 0.25 Pr(Y&lt;=y) 0.25 0.75 1 The CDF is a useful tool in calculating probabilities over intervals of a discrete random variable. However, care must be taken in considering the endpoints of the intervals - are they inclusive or exclusive; this will be clearer with a more complicated example. Consider the toss of a fair, six-sided die and denote it by \\(X\\); there are six possible outcomes (i.e. 1 to 6), all with equal probability (Table 5.4). We can obtain the probability that \\(X\\) is less than 5 from the CDF as follows: \\[Pr(X &lt; 5) = Pr(X \\le 4) = 0.6667\\] Table 5.4: PMF and CDF of \\(X\\), the toss of six-sided die. x 1 2 3 4 5 6 Pr(X=x) 0.1667 0.1667 0.1667 0.1667 0.1667 0.1667 Pr(X&lt;=x) 0.1667 0.3333 0.5 0.6667 0.8333 1 What happens if we want \\(Pr(X&gt;x)\\) or \\(Pr(X \\ge x)\\)? These can be found using the complement rule (Chapter 4): \\[Pr(X&gt;x) = 1-Pr(X \\leq x)\\] \\[Pr(X\\ge x) = 1-Pr(X &lt; x) = 1 - Pr(X \\le (x-1))\\] Hence, the probability that \\(X &gt; 4\\) can be found from \\[Pr(X &gt; 4) = 1 - Pr(X \\le 4) = 1 - 0.6667 = 0.333\\] \\[Pr(X \\ge 4) = 1 - Pr(X &lt; 4) = 1 - Pr(X \\le 3) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5\\] With discrete random variables, it is important to be careful with \\(&lt;\\), \\(\\le\\), \\(&gt;\\) and \\(\\ge\\) signs. Q5.2 Using the PMF obtained for event \\(Y\\) defined in Q5.1, a. Calculate the cumulative distribution function of \\(Y\\). b. What is the probability that \\(Y\\) will be less than 7? c. What is the probability that \\(Y\\) will be an odd number? d. Include question to calculate an interval estimate. 5.2.3 Expectation Although the outcome of a process is uncertain, the PMF can be used to determine what value might be expected on average, if the process was to be repeated many times. For a discrete random variable \\(X\\), with a finite number of outcomes \\(k\\), the expected value of \\(X\\), denoted by \\(E(X)\\) is given by \\[\\begin{equation} E(X) = \\sum_{x=k}^n xPr(X=x) \\label{discexpx} \\end{equation}\\] This is actually a weighted average where the probabilities are the weights (since the probabilities sum to one). Using this equation, the expected value from tossing a die is therefore given by \\[E(X) = (1 \\times 0.1667) + (2 \\times 0.1667) + (3 \\times 0.1667) + (4 \\times 0.1667) + (5 \\times 0.1667) + (6 \\times 0.1667) = 3.5\\] The same calculation can be seen in Table 5.5. Table 5.5: Calculations to obtain the expected value. x 1 2 3 4 5 6 Total Pr(X=x) 0.16667 0.16667 0.16667 0.16667 0.16667 0.16667 1 xPr(X=x) 0.16667 0.33333 0.50000 0.66667 0.83333 1.00000 3.5 The expected value from tossing a six-sided die is 3.5, i.e. \\(E(X)=3.5\\). We could verify this empirically if we were to throw the die a large number of times and compute the average value of all the observed outcomes. As the number of throws increases, the average will converge to 3.5 - the simple arithmetic mean of all outcomes. Hence, if all outcomes are equally likely, as in the case of a fair die, then the expected value is simply the arithmetic mean, in the long term. If the probabilities are not equal, the expected value takes into account that all outcomes are not equally likely and a weighted average must be used. Q5.3 What is the expected value for event \\(Y\\) defined in Q5.1. 5.2.4 Variance Since we cannot say with certainty what the outcome of an event will be, but only what is likely, or expected, there will be some uncertainty associated with the expected value. Can we commonly expect values to be close to the mean value or far from the mean value? To quantify the degree to which the values differ from the expected value, or how spread out they may be, we calculate the variance of \\(X\\), denoted by \\(Var(X)\\): \\[\\begin{equation} Var(X) = \\sum_{x=k}^n (x - E(X))^2Pr(X=x) \\label{discvarx} \\end{equation}\\] Thus, the variance for the outcome of tossing a die is given by: \\[Var(X)= (1-3.5)^2 \\times 0.1667 + (2-3.5)^2 \\times 0.1667 + (3-3.5)^2 \\times 0.1667 + (4-3.5)^2 \\times 0.1667\\] \\[ \\; \\; + (5-3.5)^2 \\times 0.1667 + (6-3.5)^2 \\times 0.1667\\] \\[= 1.04167 + 0.37500 + 0.04167 + 0.04167 + 0.3750 + 1.04167 = 2.917 \\] Again, we can add rows in the PMF table to help with this calculation (Table 5.6). Table 5.6: Intermediate calculations to obtain the variance for a fair, six sided die. (continued below) \\(x\\) 1 2 3 4 \\(x-E(X)\\) -2.5 -1.5 -0.5 0.5 \\((x-E(X))^2\\) 6.25 2.25 0.25 0.25 \\((x-E(X))^2\\)Pr\\((X=x)\\) 1.041667 0.375000 0.041667 0.041667 \\(x\\) 5 6 Total \\(x-E(X)\\) 1.5 2.5 \\((x-E(X))^2\\) 2.25 6.25 \\((x-E(X))^2\\)Pr\\((X=x)\\) 0.375000 1.041667 2.917 The square root of the variance of \\(X\\) is equal to the standard deviation of \\(X\\), \\[\\begin{align} sd(X) = \\sqrt {Var(X)} \\end{align}\\] Therefore, for tossing a six-sided die, the standard deviation will be: \\[sd(X) = \\sqrt{Var(X)} = \\sqrt{2.917} = 1.708\\] Q5.4 What is the variance and standard deviation value for event \\(Y\\) defined in Q5.1. 5.3 Special discrete distributions There are several discrete random variables and associated distributions which are frequently used in statistics; here we describe the Bernoulli, binomial and Poisson distributions. 5.3.1 Bernoulli distribution A Bernoulli random variable is a discrete random variable which can only have two possible outcomes (e.g. success/failure, yes/no, heads/tails) and these outcomes are represented by 0 and 1. The probability distribution takes the value of 1 with probability \\(p\\) and the value \\(0\\) with probability \\(q=1-p\\). For example, in a single coin toss (denoted by \\(X\\)) we could represent a head with a 1 and a tail with 0 (or vice versa). The probability of obtaining a head, \\(Pr(X=1) = 0.5\\) and so the probability of obtaining a tail is \\(Pr(X=0) = 1 - 0.5=0.5\\). The PMF is shown in Table 5.7. Table 5.7: The PMF for tossing a fair coin; Head=1 and Tail=0. \\(x\\) 1 0 \\(Pr(X=x)\\) \\(p\\) = 0.5 \\(1-p\\) = 0.5 Q5.5 Using the information in Table 5.7, calculate the expected value of a fair coin? Q5.6 When practising darts, a darts player considers hitting the bullseye (the centre of the dartboard) with a dart as a success and considers missing the bullseye as a failure. The probability they manage to hit a bullseye is 0.25. Create and complete a PMF for the throw of a single dart. 5.3.2 Binomial distribution Let \\(Y_1\\), \\(Y_2\\), , \\(Y_n\\) be \\(n\\) independent, Bernoulli random variables with the same probability of success, \\(p\\). Independence means that the outcome from one event has no effect on subsequent events. Define a new variable that is the sum: \\[X = \\sum_{i=1}^n Y_i\\] \\(X\\) is called a binomial random variable and is described by two parameters, the number of trials \\(n\\) and the probability of success, \\(p\\). This is written concisely using the notation \\(X \\sim \\textrm{Binomial}(n, p)\\). The random variable \\(X\\) is the total number of successes out of \\(n\\) trials and follows a binomial distribution provided that: there are only two possible outcomes for each individual trial, the probability of success, \\(p\\), is constant for all trials, there are a fixed number of trials, \\(n\\), and each trial is independent of other trials. For \\(x\\) in the set {0, 1, , \\(n\\)}, the probability mass function of the \\(\\textrm{Binomial}(n, p)\\) distribution will provide the probability of obtaining \\(x\\) successes out of \\(n\\) trials: \\[\\begin{equation} Pr(X=x) = \\frac{n!}{x!(n-x)!}p^x (1-p)^{(n-x)} \\label{binompdf} \\end{equation}\\] Example Consider a game of darts; assume the probability of hitting the bullseye is 0.25 and that one throw has no effect on subsequent throws (i.e. each throw is independent). What is the probability of hitting the bullseye exactly once in 4 attempts? Let \\(X\\) denote hitting a bullseye (a success); we have four attempts (or trials) and so \\(n=4\\), the probability of a success for each attempt is \\(p=0.25\\). We want the probability of exactly one success, so \\(x=1\\). Thus, using equation ??: \\[Pr(X=1) = \\frac{4!}{1!(4-1)!}(0.25)^1 (1-0.25)^{(4-1)} = \\frac{4!}{1!3!} \\times 0.25 \\times (0.75)^3\\] \\[ = 4 \\times 0.25 \\times 0.421875 = 0.4218\\] We can think of this equation in a more intuitive way and consider each of the components. There are four ways of throwing exactly one bullseye in four attempts - we could hit the bullseye on the first, second, third or fourth attempt. The probability of throwing one bullseye is 0.25 and the probability of missing on three attempts is given by \\(0.75 \\times 0.75 \\times 0.75\\). Thus, putting all the components together, we have \\(4 \\times 0.25 \\times (0.75)^3 = 0.4218\\) which is what we had previously. It does not matter that the bullseye was the first, second, third or fourth attempt - the binomial distribution does not consider the order of events. Equation ?? can be used to complete the PMF for this example (i.e. obtain the probability for 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 bullseye in four attempts). However, as we have seen doing these calculations can be a bit long-winded. Fortunately, there is an R function to do this. 5.3.2.1 Doing this in R To calculate values from a binomial distribution, there are a special group of functions with the suffix, binom. To obtain a probability (i.e. \\(Pr(X=x)\\)) we use the dbinom function and need to specify the parameters of the binomial distribution (i.e. \\(n\\) and \\(p\\)). # Calculate the probability from a binomial distribution n &lt;- 4 # number of trials xsuccess &lt;- 1 # required number of successes p &lt;- 0.25 # probability of a success dbinom(x=xsuccess, size=n, prob=p) [1] 0.421875 The dbinom function can be used to calculate the probabilities associated with all possible outcomes and thus create the PMF. The possible outcomes range from no bullseyes in four throws up to four bullseyes. # Create the PMF results &lt;- data.frame(x=0:4) # Specify all possible outcomes # Check dataframe has been created correctly results x 1 0 2 1 3 2 4 3 5 4 # Calculate the probabilty of each outcome results$PMF &lt;- dbinom(x=results$x, size=n, prob=p) results x PMF 1 0 0.31640625 2 1 0.42187500 3 2 0.21093750 4 3 0.04687500 5 4 0.00390625 Another function, pbinom, calculates the CDF as follows: # Calculate the CDF results$CDF &lt;- pbinom(q=results$x, size=n, prob=p) results x PMF CDF 1 0 0.31640625 0.3164063 2 1 0.42187500 0.7382812 3 2 0.21093750 0.9492188 4 3 0.04687500 0.9960938 5 4 0.00390625 1.0000000 5.3.2.2 Visualising the binomial distribution for different values of \\(n\\) and \\(p\\) We can think about the change in the shape of the binomial distribution as the probability of success changes, for example, Figure 5.1 shows the PMF for \\(n\\)=10 and three different values of \\(p\\): when \\(p\\) is low (e.g. \\(p=0.1\\)) we only expect to see a small number of successes out of the 10 trials and the distribution is skewed to the right - we cant have fewer than zero successes and we dont see many high values. when \\(p\\) is 0.5 we may expect to see about half of the 10 trials are successful and the distribution is symmetrical - about half the time we see more than 5 successes and about half the time we see fewer than 5 successes (out of the 10 trials). when \\(p\\) is high (e.g. \\(p=0.9\\)), we expect a large number of successes out of the 10 trials and the distribution is skewed to the left - we cant have more than ten successes and we dont see many low values. Figure 5.1: Probability mass functions for three different probabilities, \\(p\\), and 10 trials. You can explore some other combinations of \\(p\\) and \\(n\\) in Figure 5.2. There is also a live version here Figure 5.2: Visualising the Binomial distribution. You can see a live version by clicking here 5.3.2.3 Expectation and variance Using equation ??, we can calculate the probability the darts player throws none, one, two, three or four bullseyes but what is the number of bullseyes that the darts player might expect to hit in the long term, given they have four attempts? For a binomial random variable, there is a simple formula to calculate the expected number. The expected value of a binomial random variable is given by \\[\\begin{align} E(X) = np \\end{align}\\] and the variance is found from \\[\\begin{align} Var(X) = np(1-p) \\end{align}\\] Thus, the number of times the darts player would expect to hit the bullseye with 4 throws is \\[E(X) = 4 \\times 0.25 = 1\\] and the variance is \\[Var(X) = 4 \\times 0.25 \\times (1-0.25) = 0.75\\] Q5.7 In an online quiz, there are 10 multiple-choice questions and 4 possible options for each question, with only one correct option per question. A student, who is short on time, decides to randomly select an option for each question. a. What is the probability of selecting the correct option for a question? b. What is the expected number of questions that the student will answer correctly? c. What is the probability of answering all questions correctly? d. What is the probability of answering no questions correctly? e. Is the student more likely to select the correct answer for every question or the wrong answer for every question? Q5.8 Use the PMF values shown in section 5.3.2.1 for throwing four darts (i.e. the output from R) and equation ?? to confirm that the expected number of bullseye the player could be expected to throw is 1. Use equation ?? to confirm that the variance is 0.75 and hence calculate the standard deviation. 5.3.3 Poisson distribution The Poisson distribution is used to describe the number of events occurring in some time interval, if these events occur at a known constant mean rate (\\(\\lambda\\)) and independently of the time since the last event. An example of a Poisson variable might be the number of cars passing a certain point within a ten minute period. The interval could also apply to a specified area or volume, for example, the number of trees in a hectare. A Poisson random variable \\(X\\) is a discrete random variable with an infinite, but countable, set of possible values, in particular \\(X\\) can equal values 0, 1, 2, 3, , and \\(\\lambda &gt; 0\\). This can be written as \\(X \\sim \\textrm{Poisson}(\\lambda)\\). The PMF for a Poisson random variable \\(X\\) is given by \\[ Pr(X=x) = \\frac{e^{-\\lambda}\\lambda^x}{x!}\\] For example, the probability that \\(X=3\\) given that events occur with a mean rate \\(\\lambda=4\\) is found from: \\[ Pr(X=3) = \\frac{e^{-4} \\times 4 \\times 3}{3!} = \\frac{1.1722}{6} = 0.1954\\] The underlying process that gives rise to a Poisson distribution is one where: \\(x\\) is the number of times that an event occurs in some interval and \\(x\\) can take values 0, 1, 2,  events are independent, i.e. the occurrence of one event does not affect the occurrence of a second event the mean rate of occurrence, \\(\\lambda\\), is independent of occurrences. This is usually assumed to be constant but in reality may vary over time. two events cannot occur at exactly the same instant, instead at each very small sub-interval either exactly one event occurs or does not occur. Example The number of volcanic eruptions, \\(X\\), in Japan in a year has a Poisson distribution with \\(\\lambda = 2.4\\). What is the probability that there are no eruptions in a given year? \\[ Pr(X=0) = \\frac{e^{-2.4} \\times 2.4^ 0}{0!} = \\frac{0.0907}{1} = 0.0.907\\] 5.3.3.1 Doing this in R Similar to the binomial distribution, there are a suite of functions that can be used to obtain values from a Poisson distribution - the suffix is pois. Using the example above, the probability of selecting 5 people with XP given \\(\\lambda=4\\) can be found using: dpois(x=0, lambda=2.4) [1] 0.09071795 The CDF is found using the ppois function. For example this function can be used to calculate the probability of selecting less than 3 people with XP (i.e. \\(Pr(X \\le 3)\\)). # CDF ppois(q=2, lambda=2.4) [1] 0.5697087 # This is equivalent to dpois(x=0, lambda=2.4) + dpois(x=1, lambda=2.4) + dpois(x=2, lambda=2.4) [1] 0.5697087 5.3.3.2 Expected value and variance A Poisson random variable has the interesting property such that the expected value and the variance are equal to the mean rate of occurrence: \\[E(X) = Var(X) = \\lambda\\] Thus, returning to the example of the genetic disorder, the expected number of people out of one million people with XP is 4 and the variance is 4. The standard deviation is given by \\[sd(X) = \\sqrt{\\lambda}\\] Q5.9 The number of people buying an umbrella per day from a shop in April is Poisson distributed with mean rate 4.5. What is the probability that at least 3 people buy an umbrella on an April day? Confirm your calculation using R. 5.3.4 Comparison of binomial and Poisson distributions The binomial and Poisson distributions are similar, in that they both measure the number of events. However, the binomial is based on discrete events - it provides the probability of a certain number of events out of a fixed number of trials and the probability of success in each trial is the same. The Poisson distribution provides the probability of a certain number of events occurring in a continuous domain, such that there are very many trials each with only one event. It turns out, that if \\(n\\) is large (i.e. \\(n \\rightarrow \\infty\\)) and \\(p\\) is small (\\(p \\rightarrow 0\\)), the binomial distribution is very like the Poisson distribution. Example (XP) is a genetic disorder which means that affected individuals are extremely sensitive to ultraviolet rays. The frequency in the US and Europe is approximately 1 person in 250,000 people. If 1,000,000 people are randomly sampled, what is the probability that five people with XP are selected? In this example, there are a fixed number of trials (i.e. 1,000,000) and so the probability is calculated with a binomial PMF, where the probability of success is 1 in 250,000. To make calculations easy, we do this in R. dbinom(x=5, size=1000000, prob=1/250000) [1] 0.1562938 In this example, \\(n\\) is very large and \\(p\\) is small and so we could think of this in terms of the Poisson distribution. The mean rate of XP occurrence in one million people, \\(\\lambda\\), is 4 people per million and we want the probability of selecting 5 people with XP from a million. Hence, \\[Pr(X=5) = \\frac{e^{-4}4^5}{5!} = \\frac{18.755}{120} = 0.156\\] This is the same result as before, hence, the Poisson distribution is used to model occurrences of events that could happen a large number of times but rarely does (e.g. the occurrence of rare illnesses in a population). Note that these distributions are only similar when \\(n\\) is very large and \\(p\\) is small and these days modern computing power makes it easy to do the calculation using the binomial distribution. 5.4 Summary A discrete random variable is a quantity that can take a finite number of outcomes, but the outcome can not be predicted with certainty, only probabilistically. The probability mass function (PMF) describes these probabilities denoted by \\(Pr(X=x)\\) and the cumulative distribution function (CDF) provides \\(Pr(X \\le x)\\). Using the PMF table, the expected value and standard deviation can easily be calculated. For specific discrete distributions, these values can be found from simple formulae. 5.4.1 Learning outcomes In this chapter, you have learnt definitions for a discrete random variable probability mass function and cumulative distribution function and the expected value and variance of a discrete random variable and been introduced to special cases of discrete random variables such as Bernoulli, binomial and Poisson random variables. 5.5 Answers Q5.1 First of all, we need to consider the possible outcomes and how many ways there are to obtain them. For two dice (lets call them A and B), the table below shows all possible outcomes of event \\(Y\\): There are 36 possible combinations and the possible outcomes are 2 to 12, inclusive. There is only one way to obtain 2, (i.e. throw a 1 on both A and B) but two ways to obtain a 3 (i.e. 1 on A and 2 on B and vice versa). Using this, we can start to construct the PMF. The probability of obtaining a 2 is \\(Pr(Y=2) = \\frac{1}{36} = 0.02778\\) - a similar calculation is used to fill-in the rest of the PMF table. Q5.2 a. The CDF follows easily from the PMF in Q5.1 because it is simply the cumulative sum of the PMF. y n Pr(Y=y) Pr(Y&lt;=y) 2 1 0.02778 0.02778 3 2 0.05556 0.08333 4 3 0.08333 0.1667 5 4 0.1111 0.2778 6 5 0.1389 0.4167 7 6 0.1667 0.5833 8 5 0.1389 0.7222 9 4 0.1111 0.8333 10 3 0.08333 0.9167 11 2 0.05556 0.9722 12 1 0.02778 1 Q5.2 b. The probability that \\(Y\\) is less than, or equal to, 7 is obtained from the CDF: \\[Pr(Y \\le 7) = 0.5833 \\] Q5.2 c. The probability that \\(Y\\) will be odd is given by: \\[Pr(Y \\textrm{ is odd}) = Pr(X=3) + Pr(X=5) + Pr(X=7) + Pr(X=9) + Pr(X=11) \\] \\[ = 0.0555 + 0.1111 + 0.1667 + 0.1111 + 0.0555 = 0.5 \\] Q5.3 The expected value of \\(Y\\) is given by: \\[E(Y) = \\sum_{y=2}^{12} yPr(Y=y)\\] Adding an extra column in the table showing \\(yPr(Y=y)\\) can help with this calculation: y Pr(Y=y) y.Pr(Y=y) 2 0.02778 0.05556 3 0.05556 0.1667 4 0.08333 0.3333 5 0.1111 0.5556 6 0.1389 0.8333 7 0.1667 1.167 8 0.1389 1.111 9 0.1111 1 10 0.08333 0.8333 11 0.05556 0.6111 12 0.02778 0.3333 Sum 1 7 Thus, \\(E(Y)=7\\). Q5.4 The variance is calculated from \\[Var(Y) = \\sum_{y=2}^{12} (y-E(Y))^2Pr(Y=y)\\] Again adding columns in the PMF table can ease this calculation: y Pr(Y=y) y-E(Y) (y-E(Y))^2 (y-E(Y))^2.Pr(Y=y) 2 0.02778 -5 25 0.6944 3 0.05556 -4 16 0.8889 4 0.08333 -3 9 0.75 5 0.1111 -2 4 0.4444 6 0.1389 -1 1 0.1389 7 0.1667 0 0 0 8 0.1389 1 1 0.1389 9 0.1111 2 4 0.4444 10 0.08333 3 9 0.75 11 0.05556 4 16 0.8889 12 0.02778 5 25 0.6944 Sum 1 5.833 Thus, \\(Var(Y)=5.83\\). Q5.5 Tossing a fair coin will have two outcomes, head or tail. Thus, it is an example of a Bernoulli random variable. Here we assign head=1 and tail=0. The PMF is shown below: The expected value can be found from equation ?? i.e. \\[E(X) = \\sum_{x=k} ^ n xPr(X=x)\\] Thus, \\(E(X)=0.5\\) as shown below: \\[E(X) = \\sum_{x=0} ^ 1 xPr(X=x) = 0 \\times Pr(X=0) + 1 \\times Pr(X=1)\\] \\[E(X) = 0 \\times 0.5 + 1 \\times 0.5 = 0.5\\] Q5.6 There are two outcomes, success (bullseye) and failure (missing a bullseye). The PMF is shown below. Q5.7 a. The probability of selecting the correct multiple choice option is \\[Pr(success)= \\frac{1}{4} = 0.25\\] Q5.7 b. In this case, there are two outcomes per question: correct (success) or incorrect and there are a fixed number of questions (trials). Therefore, we consider the number of successes (\\(X\\)) to follow a binomial distribution, \\(X \\sim \\textrm{Binomial}(10, 0.25)\\). The expected number of successes is given by \\[E(X) = np = 10 \\times 0.25 = 2.5\\] Q5.7 c. Equation ?? can be used to calculate the probability of \\(x\\) successes out of \\(n\\) trials - in this example, we want the probability that all questions are answered correctly - so 10 successes: \\[Pr(X=10) = \\frac{10!}{10!(10-10)!}(0.25)^{10} (1-0.25)^{(10-10)}\\] \\[ = \\frac{10!}{10!0!}(0.25)^10 (0.75)^{0} = 0.25^{10} = 0.0953 \\times 10^{-5}\\] Q5.7 d. Similarly, if the student answers no questions correctly, then \\(x=0\\): \\[Pr(X=10) = \\frac{10!}{0!(10-0)!}(0.25)^0 (1-0.25)^{(10-0)}\\] \\[= \\frac{10!}{0!10!}(0.25)^0 (0.75)^{10} = 0.75^{10} = 0.0563\\] Q5.7 e. The probability of \\(Pr(X=0)\\) is much greater than the \\(Pr(X=10)\\), hence the student is more likely to choose the wrong option for all questions than choose all the correct options. This is commonsense perhaps, because there are more wrong options to choose from. Q5.8 Let \\(X\\) be a throw of four darts, we use the PMF table to obtain the \\(E(X)\\). x Pr(X=x) xPr(X=x) 0 0.31640625 0 1 0.421875 0.421875 2 0.2109375 0.421875 3 0.046875 0.140625 4 0.00390625 0.015625 Total 1 1 Thus, by summing the final column in the table, we see that the \\(E(X)=1\\). The variance and intermediate calculations are given in the table below. x Pr(X=x) (x-E(X))^2 (x-E(X))^2.Pr(X=x) 0 0.31640625 1 0.31640625 1 0.421875 1.23259516440783e-32 5.20001084984554e-33 2 0.2109375 1 0.2109375 3 0.046875 4 0.1875 4 0.00390625 9 0.03515625 Total 1 0.75 Thus, \\(Var(X)=0.75\\) and so \\(sd(X)=\\sqrt{0.75}=0.866\\). Q5.9 Here, we want \\(Pr(X \\le 3)\\) and \\(\\lambda=4.5\\), thus, \\[Pr(X\\le 3) = Pr(X=0) + Pr(X=1) + Pr(X=2) + Pr(X=3) \\] \\[ = \\frac{e^{-4.5}4.5^0}{0!} + \\frac{e^{-4.5}4.5^1}{1!} + \\frac{e^{-4.5}4.5^2}{2!} + \\frac{e^{-4.5}4.5^3}{3!}\\] \\[ = 0.0111 + 0.04999 + \\frac{0.2249}{2} + \\frac{1.0123}{6} = 0.3423\\] We can confirm this calculation in R using the function ppois: ppois(q=3, lambda=4.5) [1] 0.342296 # Check this calculation dpois(x=0, lambda=4.5) + dpois(x=1, lambda=4.5) + dpois(x=2, lambda=4.5) + dpois(x=3, lambda=4.5) [1] 0.342296 References "],["contrv.html", "Chapter 6 Continuous random variables 6.1 Introduction 6.2 Continuous random variables 6.3 Special continuous distributions 6.4 Summary 6.5 Answers", " Chapter 6 Continuous random variables 6.1 Introduction In the previous chapter, discrete random variables were described; a discrete variable has a countable, or finite, number of possible outcomes. But what happens when the variable is continuous and so that there are an uncountable, or infinite, number of possible outcomes? We describe such variables in this chapter and consider equivalent functions to the PMF and CDF that were described for discrete variables. Specifically we define: a continuous random variable a probability density function the cumulative distribution function, and the expectation and variance for a continuous random variable. Also in this section, we consider transformations of random variables. 6.2 Continuous random variables A continuous random variable is a random variable where the number of events in the possible outcomes, or sample space, is infinite and uncountable. At least some portion of the sample space will consist of an interval on the real number line. This is more formally defined below. 6.2.1 Probability density function If \\(X\\) is a continuous random variable, the probability density function (PDF) of \\(X\\) is a function \\(f(x)\\) such that for any two numbers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), where \\(a \\leq b\\), \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{contrvpdf} Pr(a \\le X \\le b) = \\int_a^b f(x)dx \\end{equation}\\] This equation can be translated into plain English as the probability of \\(X\\) being in the interval \\([a, b]\\) is given by the area under the curve \\(f(x)\\) between the values \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Integrating a function provides the area under the function. Two conditions that \\(f(x)\\) must satisfy are: \\[f(x) \\ge 0 \\textrm{ for all } x\\] \\[\\int _{- \\infty}^{\\infty} f(x)dx = 1 \\] What do these conditions mean? Condition 1 states that all values of \\(f(x)\\) must be greater than, or equal to, zero for all possible values of \\(x\\), i.e. \\(f(x)\\) cannot be negative. Condition 2 states that if we integrate \\(f(x)\\) (i.e. find the area) between the minimum and maximum values of \\(x\\), the value will be one. In condition 2, the minimum and maximum values are -\\(\\infty\\) and \\(\\infty\\), respectively, but in practice are generally different to this (as we see below). Note that the value of the function for a particular value of \\(x\\) is not a probability (see below). As seen in equation ??, calculating probabilities for a continuous random variables involves integration. In this course, R will be used for integration and the example given below is to illustrate the use of the method. Example Consider a chemical process that has a certain reaction. The temperature (\\(X\\)) caused by the reaction has a particular distribution on the interval [-5, 5]. The values that \\(X\\) can take are plotted on the \\(x\\)-axis and the density \\(f(x)\\) on the \\(y\\)-axis (Figure 6.1). From this figure, we can see that the \\(f(x)=0.1\\) on the interval [-5, 5] and is zero elsewhere. This is described as a uniform distribution and can be written \\(X \\sim \\textrm{Uniform} (-5, 5)\\). Figure 6.1: Probability density function for the temperature of a chemical reaction. We can verify that \\(f(x)\\) is a PDF by checking that it satisfies the two conditions noted above. The limits in this example are [-5, 5] and we can see that \\(f(x)=0.1\\) on this interval which satisfies the first condition. The second condition requires a bit more work because we need to integrate the function between these limits (this is just for illustration): \\[\\int _{-5}^{5} f(x)dx = \\int _{-5}^{5} 0.1 dx = 0.1[x ]_{-5}^5 = 0.1(5 - -5) = 0.1 \\times 10 = 1\\] Thus the area under the curve equals 1 and thus satisfies condition 2. For a discrete random variable, the PMF defined the probability associated with a certain outcome and the sum of the probabilities for all outcomes equaled one. We have just seen that for a continuous random variable, integration of the PDF over all possible values also equals one (condition 2). Therefore, to obtain the probability associated with a range of specified values, we integrate the PDF over the range of the specified values - hence, equation ??. For example, the probability that \\(X\\) is between -2.5 and 2.5 is given by: \\[Pr(-2.5 \\le X \\le 2.5) = \\int_{-2.5}^{2.5} 0.1 \\mathrm{d}x \\] \\[ = 0.1[x]_{-2.5}^{2.5} = 0.1[2.5 - -2.5] = 0.1 \\times 5 = 0.5\\] With a discrete random variable, the probability associated with a particular value (\\(Pr(X=x)\\)) can be calculated. This is not the same for a continuous random variable and only the probability for a range of possible values can be calculated. Think about a distribution of a continuous variable such as height (denoted by \\(H\\)); the probability that someone is between 165-166 cm can be found from \\[Pr(165 \\le H \\le 166) = \\int_{165}^{166} f(h)dh \\] If the interval of interest reduces, say \\(Pr(165 \\le H \\le 165.5)\\), then it follows that the probability will also reduce. As the interval gets narrower the probability will also reduce until the interval is so precise that the probability is effectively zero and hence, the probability of a particular value is zero. Thus for continuous distributions, only intervals are considered. 6.2.2 Cumulative distribution function The cumulative distribution function, (CDF), for a continuous random variable is the same as for a discrete random variable, i.e. \\[ F(x) = Pr(X \\leq x) \\] However, while the calculation of the CDF involves summation for a discrete random variable it involves integration for a continuous random variable. For example, the probability that the temperature is less than 0 is given by: \\[ F(x) = Pr(X \\leq 0) = \\int_{-5}^{0} 0.1 \\mathrm{d}x \\] \\[ = 0.1[x]_{-5}^{0} = 0.1[0 - -5] = 0.1 \\times 5 = 0.5 \\] This calculation is shown to illustrate how the probability is obtained. In practice, we will use R to do the calculations because integrating some of the specific distributions we will consider is a non-trivial task. 6.2.2.1 Doing this in R As with the binomial distribution shown in the previous chapter, there are functions which can be used to calculate probabilities for a uniform distribution; not surprisingly, the functions have the suffix unif. To define a uniform function, the minimum and maximum values are required (in this example of a chemical reaction, these are -5 and 5, respectively). # Create a range of values (make wider than limits of the distribution) xvalues &lt;- seq(-6, 6, by=0.01) # Create a dataframe results &lt;- data.frame(x=xvalues) # Calculate density specifying limits of distribution results$density &lt;- dunif(x=results$x, min=-5, max=5) # Plot PDF plot(results$x, results$density, type=&quot;l&quot;, xlab=&quot;x&quot;, ylab=&quot;Density&quot;) # Calculate CDF results$CDF &lt;- punif(q=results$x, min=-5, max=5) # Plot CDF plot(results$x, results$CDF, type=&quot;l&quot;, xlab=&quot;x&quot;, ylab=&quot;CDF&quot;) 6.2.3 Expectation and variance Similar to a discrete random variable, the expectation for a continuous random variable is like a weighted sum, but this time integration is required. \\[\\begin{equation} E(X) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}xf(x)dx \\end{equation}\\] Likewise the variance is given by, \\[\\begin{equation} Var(X) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}(x - E(X))^2f(x)dx \\end{equation}\\] which is equivalent to \\[\\begin{equation} Var(X) = E(X^2) - [E(X)]^2 \\end{equation}\\] Example In the chemical reaction, the expected value is given by \\[E(X) = \\int_{-5}^{5} x0.1 dx\\] \\[ =0.1[\\frac{x^2}{2}]_{-5}^{5} = \\frac{0.1}{2}[25 - 25] = 0 \\] Thus, the expected temperature in the chemical reaction is 0; this makes sense if we look at Figure 6.1 - it is the central value of \\(X\\). 6.3 Special continuous distributions An example of a uniform distribution has just been introduced. There are several other distributions that will crop up later in the course, specifically the normal, \\(t\\) and \\(F\\) distributions. These theoretical distributions are characterised by parameters which describe the location, scale and shape of the curve. In general, the properties of these parameters are as follows: location fixes the mid point of the distribution (or the lower point, depending on the distribution) on the number scale or \\(x\\)-axis (e.g. is the midpoint of the distribution at 10 or 100 etc.), scale determines length of the \\(x\\)-axis (e.g. how spread out the distribution is along the \\(x\\)-axis), shape allows the curve to take a variety of shapes, perhaps shifting or stretching the distribution along the \\(x\\)-axis. Not all distributions have all these parameters and the distributions described in this document are characterised by only one or two parameters. The normal distribution is used for many applications and so we look at this distribution in detail. 6.3.1 Normal distribution A normally distributed random variable \\(X\\) is defined by two parameters, \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma^2\\), where \\(\\mu=E(X)\\) and \\(\\sigma^2=Var(X)\\). This can be written more concisely as \\(X \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)\\). The normal distribution is symmetrical and the parameter \\(\\mu\\) defines the centre of the distribution and \\(\\sigma^2\\) defines the spread. How different values of \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma^2\\) affect the shape of the distribution can be seen in Figure 6.2. Note that, because of condition 2, the area under all the curves is one and so there is a trade-off between the maximum density of the distribution and how spread out the distribution is along the \\(x\\)-axis. Figure 6.2: Examples of normal distributions with different values of \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma^2\\); \\(N(0,4)\\) (black line), \\(N(0,25)\\) (blue dashes), \\(N(10, 25)\\) (black dots). The probability distribution function for the normal distribution is given by: \\[\\begin{equation} f(x; \\mu, \\sigma) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}}e^{[\\frac{-1}{2\\sigma^2}(x-\\mu)^2]} \\end{equation}\\] Normal distributions have some useful properties (which we make use of in future chapters): they are symmetric about the mean and median (which are equal) 68% of observations are within \\(\\pm 1 \\times \\sigma\\) of \\(\\mu\\) (i.e. 68% of the area is within the interval \\(\\mu-\\sigma\\) and \\(\\mu + \\sigma\\)) 95% of observations are within \\(\\pm 1.96 \\times \\sigma\\) of \\(\\mu\\) 99% of observations are within \\(\\pm 2.58 \\times \\sigma\\) of \\(\\mu\\) This can be seen in Figure 6.3. Figure 6.3: Normal distribution, \\(N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)\\); 68% of the values are within 1 standard deviation of \\(\\mu\\) (dashed lines), 95% of the values are within 1.96 standard deviations (dotted line) and 99% within 2.58 standard deviations. 6.3.1.1 Doing calculations in R Many measurements will have empirical frequency distributions that are normal, or nearly normal. This can be helpful in that we can then use this information to find out about the population, given knowledge of \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma\\). Remember that condition 2 specifies that the area under \\(f(x)\\) for all possible values of \\(X\\) is equal to one (there is an equivalent condition for discrete random variables), hence the area of different intervals can inform us about the probability of these intervals. For example, assume the distribution of womens heights (\\(X\\)) is approximately normal with a mean 160cm and standard deviation 6cm (i.e. \\(X \\sim N(160, 6^2)\\)). We want to find the probability that a randomly chosen woman is smaller than 150cm (\\(Pr(X \\le 150)\\)) and this is given by the area under the curve less than 150 cm (Figure 6.4). Figure 6.4: Plot of the distribution for womens height, \\(N(160, 6^2)\\). The dashed line is at 150 cm and the red line is at 175 cm. As we have seen, we can find this from the cumulative distribution function and we can use R to do the calculations: # Specify parameters mu &lt;- 160 # Mean sigma &lt;- 6 # Standard deviation # CDF - area under the curve less than q pnorm(q=150, mean=mu, sd=sigma, lower.tail=TRUE) [1] 0.04779035 The probability is 0.04779, hence, approximately 4.78% of women will be less than 150 cm. What about the probability that a randomly chosen women will be greater than 175 cm (i.e. \\(Pr(X &gt; 175)\\))? In this case we want the area under the curve for values greater than 175 (red line in Figure 6.4). Again we can use R to do the calculations and there are two possible options. The first calculation uses the complement rule and the CDF. Hence, \\[Pr(X &gt; 175) = 1 - Pr(X \\le 175)\\] In R, the command is: 1 - pnorm(q=175, mean=mu, sd=sigma) [1] 0.006209665 We can be somewhat casual about \\(\\le\\) and \\(&lt;\\) (and also \\(\\ge\\) and \\(&gt;\\)) signs because as we have seen the \\(Pr(X=a) = 0\\). (Note, this does not apply to discrete random variables.) R provides an alternative method to obtain \\(Pr(X &gt; 175)\\), if an additional argument is specified in the pnorm function. By default, the area to the left of a specified value (q), or the lower tail (i.e. the CDF), is returned by pnorm. Specifying the argument lower.tail=FALSE will return the area to the right of q (the upper tail), hence, we can obtain the relevant probability directly: # Area under curve greater than q pnorm(q=175, mean=mu, sd=sigma, lower.tail=FALSE) [1] 0.006209665 These functions make calculating probabilities relatively straight forward, for example, we can find the probability a women is between 148 and 172 cm, i.e. \\(Pr(148 \\le X \\le 172)\\). # Area under curve in interval 148 to 172 area172 &lt;- pnorm(q=172, mean=mu, sd=sigma, lower.tail=TRUE) area148 &lt;- pnorm(q=148, mean=mu, sd=sigma, lower.tail=TRUE) area172 - area148 [1] 0.9544997 Why is this probability not surprising? Hint, how many values of \\(\\sigma\\) are these limits away from the mean? The interval 148 to 172 is \\(\\mu \\pm 2 \\sigma\\) and we know that for a normal distribution, 95% of the distribution falls within 1.96 standard deviations of the mean. Hence, we would expect the probability to be very close to 95%. 6.3.2 Standard normal distribution A special case of the normal distribution is the standard normal distribution where \\(\\mu=0\\) and \\(\\sigma^2=1\\). The PDF is simpler: \\[\\begin{equation} f(x; \\mu, \\sigma) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}e^{\\frac{(x - \\mu)^2}{2}} \\end{equation}\\] The standard normal distribution is very useful because any given normal distribution can be transformed to a standard normal PDF by converting the normal random variables to standard units. This process, called standardization, is simply \\[\\begin{equation} Z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\end{equation}\\] A random variable from a standard normal distribution is often denoted by \\(Z\\), i.e \\(Z \\sim N(0, 1)\\). Sometimes the term normalisation is used instead of standardisation but they refer to different transformations: normalisation usually means to scale the data values so they they lie between 0 and 1; standardisation transforms the data to have a mean 0 and standard deviation of one. Example Assume that IQ (intelligent quotient) is distributed as \\(N(100,15^2)\\). What is the IQ for someone at the 99th percentile i.e. what is \\(q\\) such that \\(Pr(X \\le X q)=0.99\\)? We can find this value using the CDF function in R. qnorm(p=0.99, mean=100, sd=15) [1] 134.8952 Alternatively, we can find the 99th percentile for the standard normal, then multiply by \\(\\sigma\\) and add \\(\\mu\\) i.e. \\[ X = Z \\sigma + \\mu\\] # Use standard normal and transform qnorm(p=0.99, mean=0, sd=1)*15 + 100 [1] 134.8952 Thus, the IQ for someone in the 99th percentile will be nearly 135. 6.3.3 Simple transformations of random variables Sometimes we may wish to consider transformations of random variables other than standardisation; for example a variable has been measured in some unit (e.g. inches) and we want to transform it to another unit of measurement (e.g. centimetres) and find the expected value in the new units of measurement. There are some simple rules that we can apply in these cases which apply for both continuous and discrete random variables. 6.3.3.1 Adding and multipling by a constant Let \\(X\\) be a random variable and let \\(Y\\) be some function of \\(X\\) that involves either the multiplication of a constant \\(a\\), the addition of some constant \\(b\\) or indeed both. The expected value of \\(Y\\), \\(E(Y)\\), can then be found using these simple rules: \\(Y = aX\\) and \\(E(Y) = aE(X)\\). \\(Y = X + b\\) and \\(E(Y) = E(X) + b\\). \\(Y = aX + b\\) and \\(E(Y)= aE(X) + b\\). Example The expected temperature at a particular location was \\(10^o\\)Celsius. What is the expected value in Fahrenheit? The conversion from Celsius (\\(C\\)) to Fahrenheit (\\(F\\)) is \\[ F = 1.8C + 32\\] Therefore, the expected value in Fahrenheit is given by: \\[E(F) = 1.8E(C) + 32 = 1.8 \\times 10 + 32 = 50\\] Hence, the expected value in Fahrenheit is 50\\(^o\\). What about the variance of a simple transformation? Similar rules to those for the expectation also apply: \\(Y = aX\\) then \\(Var(Y)= a^2Var(X)\\) \\(Y = X + b\\) then \\(Var(Y)= Var(X)\\) \\(Y = aX + b\\) then \\(Var(Y)= a^2Var(X)\\). If a constant is added to, or subtracted from, \\(X\\), then the expected value is shifted by this amount but the variability is unchanged. Conversely, if a variable is multiplied by a constant, the expected value is also multiplied by the constant and the variance is multiplied by the constant squared. We can illustrate these rules empirically by generating some random data. Here we generate data for a variable \\(X \\sim N(\\mu=20, \\sigma^2=9)\\). # Set seed set.seed(1234) # Generate 100 random values from a normal distribution (with mean 20 and sd 3) X &lt;- rnorm(n=100, mean=20, sd=3) # Expected value and variance of X mean(X) [1] 19.52971 var(X) [1] 9.07947 The transformation is specified \\(Y = 2X + 5\\) and so we create \\(Y\\) and then obtain the mean and variance using the usual R functions. # Let Y = 2X + 5 Y &lt;- (2 * X) + 5 # Expected value and variance of Y mean(Y) [1] 44.05943 var(Y) [1] 36.31788 Thus, the mean of \\(Y\\) is 44.06 and the variance is 36.32. Now, we use the rules above to obtain the mean and variance of \\(Y\\) from the mean and variance of \\(X\\), \\(E(X)\\) and \\(Var(X)\\): # Use rules to obtain expected value of y (2*mean(X)) + 5 [1] 44.05943 # and variance 4*var(X) [1] 36.31788 The same values were obtained as before; the other rules can be similarly demonstrated. 6.3.3.2 Adding random variables Sometimes we may wish to consider a transformation including two random variables, \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\). In this case, the expected value for adding the variables, (\\(X + Y\\)), is given by: \\[\\begin{equation} E(X + Y) = E(X) + E(Y) \\end{equation}\\] Similarly, the expected value for subtracting the variables, \\((X-Y)\\), is given by: \\[\\begin{equation} E(X - Y) = E(X) - E(Y) \\end{equation}\\] If we assume that \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are independent, the variances can simply be added to obtain both \\(Var(X+Y)\\) and \\(Var(X-Y)\\): \\[\\begin{equation} Var(X+Y) = Var(X-Y) = Var(X) + Var(Y) \\end{equation}\\] More complicated transformations can be considered using previous rules, for example, \\[Z = a + bX + cY\\] Hence, \\[\\begin{equation} E(Z) = a + bE(X) + cE(Y) \\label{rvtransexp} \\end{equation}\\] and, similarly if \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are independent, the variance is given by \\[\\begin{equation} Var(Z) = b^2Var(X) + c^2Var(Y) \\end{equation}\\] Example A time-and-motion study measures the time required for an assembly line worker to perform two successive repetitive tasks. The data showed that the time required to position a part on an automobile chassis varied from car to car with mean 11 seconds and standard deviation 2 seconds. The time required to attach the part to the chassis also varied, with mean 20 seconds and standard deviation 4 seconds. What is the expected combined time for positioning and attaching the part? To answer this, let \\(X\\) represent the time to position the part and \\(Y\\) represent the time to attach the part. The expected total time taken to position and attach a part, \\(X+Y\\), is given by: \\[ E(X+Y) = E(X) + E(Y) = 11 + 20 = 31 \\textrm{ seconds}\\] The time-and-motion study finds that the times required for the two steps are independent, i.e. the time to attach a part is not affected by the time taken to position the part. What is the standard deviation for the time to position and attach the part? \\[V(X+Y) = V(X) + V(Y) = 2^2 + 4^2 = 20 \\] \\[SD(X+Y) = \\sqrt{V(X+Y)} = \\sqrt{20} = 4.47 \\textrm{ seconds}\\] So far we have considered variables that are independent but if this is not the case, then we need to take into account how closely related they are. 6.3.3.3 Covariance and correlation If \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are not independent, then the covariance, a measure of the degree of association or similarity, of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), needs to be taken into account when calculating the variance: \\[\\begin{align} Var(X+Y) = Var(X) + Var(Y) + 2Cov(X,Y) \\\\ Var(X-Y) = Var(X) + Var(Y) - 2Cov(X,Y) \\end{align}\\] The covariance is explored further but first another useful rule theorem is required. If two independent random variables are multiplied, the expected value of the product is the product of the expected values, or more succinctly: \\[\\begin{equation} E(XY) = E(X)E(Y) \\end{equation}\\] The covariance between two random variables \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) is: \\[\\begin{align} Cov(X,Y) = E[(X-E(X))(Y-E(Y))] \\\\ = E(XY) - E(X)E(Y) \\end{align}\\] Independent random variables have zero covariance. A related measure is the correlation coefficient, \\(\\rho\\), which measures the linear relationship between two variables: \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{corcoeffeqn} \\rho = \\frac{Cov(X,Y)}{\\sqrt{Var(X)Var(Y)}} \\end{equation}\\] Correlation is explored further in Chapter 13.2 and so it is not expanded on here, except to say that \\(\\rho\\) (or denoted by \\(r\\) for a sample) can take values between -1 and 1 (inclusive) and when \\(\\rho=1\\), there is a positive linear relationship between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), when \\(\\rho=-1\\), there is a negative relationship between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) and when \\(\\rho=0\\), there is no relationship between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\). We can rearrange equation ?? so that \\[Cov(X,Y) = \\rho \\sqrt{Var(X)Var(Y)}\\] and then substitute into equations, such that \\[\\begin{align} Var(X+Y) = Var(X) + Var(Y) + 2\\rho \\sqrt{Var(X)Var(Y)} \\\\ Var(X-Y) = Var(X) + Var(Y) - 2\\rho \\sqrt{Var(X)Var(Y)} \\end{align}\\] Example How would the standard deviation change, if the time taken to position and attach a part were dependent, with a correlation coefficient of 0.8? \\[Var(X+Y) = Var(X) + Var(Y) + 2\\rho\\sqrt{Var(X)Var(Y)}\\] \\[ =2^2 + 4^2 + 2 \\times 0.8 \\times \\sqrt{2^2 \\times 4^2} = 32.8\\] \\[SD(X+Y) = \\sqrt{32.8} = 5.73 \\textrm{ seconds}\\] Q6.1 Using the time-and-motion study described in the example, the variation in the workers performance is reduced by better training, and hence the standard deviations of positioning and attaching the parts has decreased. Will this decrease change the expected value of the combined steps, if the mean times for the two steps remain as before? Q6.2 A company makes a profit of 2,000 on each military unit sold and 3,500 on each civilian unit. Thus the profit is from military units is 2,000\\(X\\) where \\(X\\) is the number of military units sold; similarly, the profit from civilian units is 3,500\\(Y\\), where \\(Y\\) is the number of civilian units sold. The expected number of military units to be sold is 5,000 and the expected number of civilian units to be sold is 445. Using this information answer the following questions. a. What is the expected profit on military units? b. What is the expected total profit for military and civilian units? c. What is the expected difference in profit between military and civilian units? d. Assuming that the number of military and civilian units sold are independent, describe how to calculate the variance of the total profit. Will this be different to the variance of the difference calculated in part c? Q6.3 Planks of wood are cut into two sizes, short and long. The length (in metres) of the short planks has a \\(N(0.5, 0.01)\\) distribution and the length of the long planks has a \\(N(1.5, 0.0625)\\) distribution. It was found that one short plank and two long planks placed end to end were required to make one floorboard. a. What is the mean length of floorboards? b. Assuming that the two lengths of plank are independent, what is the variance of the floorboard. c. What is the probability that the floorboard will be too long for a room 4 metres in length? 6.4 Summary There are analogous functions to the PMF and CDF for continuous random variables, the main difference is that we need to integrate under the curves to obtain probabilities, expected values and variances rather than summation. The normal and standard normal distributions have been described in detail. These distributions crop up frequently in statistics; other distributions considered in following chapters are the \\(t\\) and \\(F\\). Random variables can be transformed in various ways and there are simple rules which can be applied to obtain the expected values and variances of these transformations. 6.4.1 Learning outcomes In this chapter, you have learnt definitions for the PDF and CDF expectation and variance for continuous random variables. The normal and standard normal distributions have been described in detail and rules for obtaining the expected value and variances for simple transformations of random variables have been illustrated. 6.5 Answers Q6.1 No. Changing the standard deviations will not change the means. Q6.2 a. Consider \\(X_T = 2000X\\), then using \\[E(X_T) = 2000E(X) = 2000 \\times 5000 = 10000000\\] the expected profit is \\(\\pounds 10,000,000\\). Q6.2 b. The expected total profit is obtained from \\[ E(2000X+3500Y) = 2000E(X) + 3500E(Y) = 2000 \\times 5000 + 3500 \\times 445 = 11557500 \\] Hence, the expected total profit is £\\(11,557,500\\). Q6.2 c. The expected difference in profits between military and civilian sales can be calculated from \\[E(2000X - 3500Y) = 2000E(X) - 3500E(Y) = 2000 \\times 5000 - 3500 \\times 445 = 8442500\\] Thus, the expected difference in profits is £8,442,500. Q6.2 d. The variance for \\(2000X\\) units is given by \\(Var(2000X) = 2000^2Var(X)\\) and similarly the variance for \\(3500Y\\) is \\(Var(3500Y) = 3500^2Var(Y)\\). If the units sold for military and civilian use are independent, then the variances can be added to calculate the variance of the total profit: \\[Var(2000X + 3500Y) = 2000^2Var(X) + 3500^2Var(Y)\\] The variance will be the same for the difference in profits. Q6.3 Let \\(X\\) represent the short planks and \\(Y\\) represent the long planks and so a floorboard is made up of \\(F = X + Y1 + Y2\\). Q6.3 a. Using equation ??, let \\(a=0\\), \\(b=1\\) and \\(c=2\\), \\[E(F) = 1 \\times E(X) + E(Y1) + E(Y2) = 0.5 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 3.5\\] The expected length of a floorboard is 3.5m. Q6.3 b. Similarly, the variance is given by \\[Var(F) = 1 \\times Var(X) + Var(Y1) + Var(Y2) = 0.01 + 0.0625 + 0.065 = 0.135\\] Q6.3 c. The probability \\(Pr(F &gt; 4)\\) is required, where \\(F \\sim N(3.5, 0.26)\\). R can be used to find this probability with the pnorm command. There are two equivalent commands: Using \\(1 - Pr(X \\le 4)\\) 1 - pnorm(q=4, mean=3.5, sd=sqrt(0.26)) [1] 0.1633998 Alternatively, pnorm(q=4, mean=3.5, sd=sqrt(0.26), lower.tail=FALSE) [1] 0.1633998 Therefore, the probability that a floorboard is greater than 4 m is 0.163.

William C. Blackwelder. 7.1 Introduction We would like a sample to be representative of the target population. If we were to generate several samples from the same population and then calculate the sample statistics for each sample (e.g. a mean), it is likely that the statistics would differ between samples - this is due to sampling error and is unavoidable. However, the extent to which these sample means will vary is somewhat predictable and we can use this information to provide a measure of uncertainty for the sample statistic. This takes the form of an interval between which we have some confidence that the true mean lies - this is called a confidence interval (CI). There are several methods which can be used to obtain a CI, depending on whether the data fulfill various criteria. In this chapter you will: examine the behaviour of the sample mean quantify the precision of the sample mean and hence calculate a confidence interval, quantify the precision of the difference between two sample means and again calculate a confidence interval, and finally consider an alternative approach for obtaining a confidence interval. In this chapter we are mainly concerned with sample means but similar uncertainty will exist for other sample statistics such as the median, variance and proportions. In the final section we consider how the uncertainty of these other statistics can be quantified. 7.2 Uncertainty of the sample mean To illustrate the variability in the sample, we consider the distribution of womens heights. Assume that height is normally distributed with a mean of 160 cm and a standard deviation of 6 cm, i.e. Height \\(\\sim N(\\mu=160, \\sigma^2=6^2)\\). If we randomly draw five values from this distribution, then these might be: 152.7, 161.7, 166.6, 145.9 and 162.6 The mean of this sample is 157.9 cm and this is quite close to the population mean. Usually however, we dont know the population mean and so, in general, we want to know how well a sample mean represents the population. To find out how good an estimate is, we need to know how precise it is and this depends on: the sample size, and the variability in the population. Intuitively, we might expect that if the population is very variable, then the distribution of sample means may also be variable. Conversely, if the population is not very variable, then we might expect that sample means will be similar to the population mean and also to each other. In addition, a large sample may more closely resemble the population than a small sample and, hence, the sample mean from a large sample may be more similar to the population mean than the sample mean from a small sample. This concept can be illustrated by generating many samples from a known population, calculating the mean for each sample and looking at the distribution of the sample means. In Figure (7.1), 1000 sample means have been generated from samples of different sizes, drawn from a normal distribution with mean 160 and standard deviation 6. Figure 7.1: Distributions of 1000 sample means using four different sizes of sample. The underlying population was \\(N(160,6^2)\\). There are two things to notice about these distributions of sample means: the distributions are centered about the true population mean of 160, and the sample means range from about 152 to 168 when the sample size is 5, but this spread reduces as the sample size increases. These patterns will be similar for any distribution of sample estimates and so can be used to inform how precise a sample mean might be. 7.2.1 Precision of the sample mean The standard deviation of the sample means is found by dividing the population standard deviation by the square root of the sample size being averaged: \\[sd(\\textrm{sample mean}) = \\frac{\\textrm{Population SD}}{\\sqrt{\\textrm{sample size}}}\\] The standard deviation of a sampling distribution is called a standard error. Therefore, substituting the usual notation (see Chapter 3) into this formula, the standard error of the mean is given by: \\[se(\\hat \\mu) = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}\\] Thus, using the height data, the standard error for a sample size of 5 is given by: \\[se(\\hat \\mu) = \\frac{6}{\\sqrt{5}} = 2.68\\] As shown in Figure 7.1, the standard deviation (and hence standard error) of the distribution of the sample mean reduces as the sample size increases; the standard error using a sample size of 30 is \\[se(\\hat \\mu) = \\frac{6}{\\sqrt{30}} = 1.095\\] 7.2.2 Confidence interval with known \\(\\sigma\\) In this example, we assumed the data were normally distributed and, as we have seen in Figure 7.1, the distributions of the sample mean were also normally distributed. This is very handy because we know that for any normally distributed variable, 95% of the time a randomly chosen value will fall within 1.96 standard deviations of the mean. Hence, the sample mean will fall within 1.96 standard deviations of the true population mean about 95% of the time (or for about 95% of samples taken). While we rarely know the true population mean, it is likely that the estimate of the sample mean will fall within about 1.96 standard deviations of the population mean. Thus, we can derive an upper and lower limit between which we think the true population mean will lie - this is called a confidence interval. A 95% confidence interval for the sample mean is given by the following: \\[ \\hat \\mu - 1.96 \\times \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} \\quad ; \\quad \\hat \\mu + 1.96 \\times \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}\\] or, writing this more succinctly as, \\[ \\hat \\mu \\pm 1.96 \\times \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}\\] Thus, for a sample of size 5, the 95% confidence interval for the mean will be \\[157.9 \\pm 1.96 \\times 2.68\\] \\[157.9 \\pm 5.25\\] which results in the limits 152.6 cm and 163.2 cm. We can see for a distribution with a mean and variance equal to our sample mean and standard deviation i.e. \\(N(\\mu=157.9, \\sigma^2=2.68^2)\\), that 95% of the distribution lies between these limits (Figure 7.2). This means that if we repeatedly take samples of size 5, calculate the sample mean and a 95% CI for the mean, 95% of the confidence intervals will include the true population mean. Figure 7.2: Sampling distribution of the sample mean for a sample of size 5. 95% of the central part of the distribution is shaded blue. The sample mean is shown by the dotted line. We can think of 1.96 as a value which multiplies the standard error to provide a value above and below the sample mean to create the confidence interval. Increasing or decreasing this multiplier will result in wider and narrower intervals and we look at this later. Before that we consider a fundamental theorem in statistics. To illustrate a confidence interval we used data from a normal distribution and, in general, we dont usually know if the data are drawn from a normal distribution! However, help is at hand in the form of the Central Limit Theorem. 7.2.2.1 Central limit theorem The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) states that no matter what distribution we sample from, the distribution of the sample means (\\(\\hat \\mu\\)) is closely approximated by the normal distribution in large samples. We can see this in Figure 7.1, but how large a sample is required for reliable estimation of the population mean? The sample size required depends somewhat on the data: for data from symmetrical distributions a sample of 5 may be sufficient; for heavily skewed data a sample of 50 may be required. In calculating a CI, we also need to consider the variability in the data and this is quantified by the standard deviation. In the example above, we knew the population standard deviation but what happens if we dont know the population standard deviation? We consider this next. 7.2.3 Confidence interval with unknown \\(\\sigma\\) If the population standard deviation is unknown (and in fact the population standard deviation is rarely known), the population standard deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)) is simply replaced by the sample standard deviation (\\(s\\)) in the formula for the standard error: \\[se(\\hat \\mu)=\\frac{\\textrm{sample SD}}{\\sqrt{\\textrm{sample size}}} = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}\\] Thus, for the sample of five heights, the sample standard deviation is 8.415 and so the sample standard error is \\[se(\\hat \\mu) = \\frac{8.415}{\\sqrt{5}} = 3.763\\] When we sample data from a normal distribution and we know the population standard deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)), the distribution of sample means is exactly normally distributed about the true population mean, \\(\\mu\\). When we dont know the population standard deviation, we introduce a new source of variability because we use the sample standard deviation of the data instead of a known population standard deviation. Therefore, rather than using quantiles from the normal distribution to find the multipliers needed to calculate the confidence interval, we use a different distribution; the \\(t\\) distribution is used to find the multiplier. Before continuing with the calculation we look at the \\(t\\) distribution and see how it compares to a standard normal distribution. 7.2.3.1 The \\(t\\) distribution The \\(t\\) distribution (also known as Students \\(t\\) distribution) is symmetrical about zero and has a similar shape to the standard normal distribution. However, rather than being defined by a mean and variance, the \\(t\\) distribution is indexed by a parameter called the degrees of freedom (\\(df\\)) (i.e. \\(t_{df}\\)). The degrees of freedom are determined by the sample size such that \\(df=n-1\\). When \\(n\\) is small the \\(t\\) distribution has fatter tails and a flatter top compared with the normal distribution; as \\(n\\) (and thus \\(df\\)) increases, the \\(t\\) distribution become more and more like a standard normal distribution (Figure 7.3). As an example, when \\(n=11\\), and hence \\(t_{df=10}\\), only 92% of the distribution falls within 1.96 standard deviations either side the mean, whereas for a standard normal distribution, 95% of the distribution falls within 1.96 standard deviations of the mean. For a \\(t_{df=10}\\) distribution, 95% of the distribution will lie between 2.23 standard deviations of the mean. Figure 7.3: Comparison of standard normal and \\(t\\) distributions with 4 and 10 \\(df\\). 7.2.3.2 Confidence interval for the sample mean When the population standard deviation is unknown and estimated by the sample standard deviation, the multiplier is found from the \\(t\\) distribution such that the confidence interval limits are found from \\[\\hat{\\mu} - t_{(1-(\\alpha/2), df=n-1)} \\times \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}} \\quad;\\quad \\hat{\\mu} + t_{(1-(\\alpha/2), df=n-1)} \\times \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}\\] or more succinctly, \\[\\hat{\\mu}\\pm t_{(1-(\\alpha/2), df=n-1)}se(\\hat{\\mu})\\] where \\(t_{(1-\\alpha/2, df=n-1)}\\) represents a value (multiplier) from the \\(t_{df=(n-1)}\\) distribution; this indicates how far we need to extend either side of the sample estimate in order to catch the true mean with some associated confidence, represented by \\(\\alpha\\). The confidence represents how confident we want to be that the interval contains the true mean. The most frequently quoted CI are 95% confidence intervals (i.e. we want to be 95% confident that the interval contains the true mean). For 95% CI, \\(\\alpha = 5\\)%, thus \\(1 - \\frac{\\alpha}{2} = 1 - \\frac{0.05}{2} = 0.975\\). Thus, the multiplier is the quantile \\(q\\) such that \\(Pr(X \\le q) = 0.975\\) where \\(X \\sim t_{{df}}\\). To illustrate how to find the multiplier, lets return to the height sample data. Figure @ref(fig:tdist.ca) shows that a \\(Pr(X \\le 2.78) = 0.975\\) and because the \\(t\\) distribution is symmetric round zero, we know that \\(Pr(X \\le -2.78) = 0.025\\), hence 95% of the area (the red shaded area) will lie between -2.78 and 2.78 where \\(df=4\\). (ref:tdist.ca) Probability density distribution for \\(t_{df=4}\\). The red shaded area is 95% of the area with 2.5% in each tail. (#fig:tdist.ca)(ref:tdist.ca) Thus using the sample standard deviation, the interval is found from: \\[157.9 \\pm t_{0.975, \\textrm{df}=4} \\times 3.763\\] and substituting in the value for the \\(t\\)-multiplier, \\(t_{0.975, \\textrm{df}=4} = 2.78\\), gives \\[157.9 \\pm 2.78 \\times 3.763\\] \\[157.9 \\pm 10.46\\] Thus, the 95% confidence interval for the mean is 147.4 to 168.4 cm; 95% of the time the true mean will lie in the range 147.4 and 168.4 cm. This is wider than the confidence interval found using the population standard deviation (which was 152.6 to 163.2 cm) because of the additional uncertainty about the variability of the distribution. 7.2.3.3 What does confidence mean? Confidence is a long run process, it does not apply to any one particular interval. Essentially, if we repeatedly take samples from a population and calculate a 95% CI (just as we have done above for one sample), 95% of the intervals will contain the true population mean. That means 5% of the intervals will not contain the true mean! If we wanted to increase the chance of catching the true mean, the interval could be widened by considering 99% confidence intervals. In this case for our sample of five heights, the \\(t\\)-multiplier would be 4.6 resulting in an interval of 140.6 to 175.2 cm. Conversely, a 90% confidence interval would be narrower i.e. (149.9 to 165.9 cm). Both 90% and 99% confidence intervals are used but 95% CI are the ones most frequently stated. 7.2.3.4 Doing this in R To start with, we illustrate how to calculate a confidence interval by obtaining all the individual components. The \\(t\\)-multiplier is found from the cumulative distribution function for the \\(t\\) distribution qt - this is similar to the qnorm function introduced in Chapter 6. # 95% CI for the sample mean assuming underlying population is normal # Create object for sample data hgt &lt;- c(152.7, 161.7, 166.6, 145.9, 162.6) # Save the individual components of the CI # Sample mean mean.hgt &lt;- mean(hgt) mean.hgt [1] 157.9 # Sample standard deviation sd.hgt &lt;- sd(hgt) sd.hgt [1] 8.415165 # Number of observations n &lt;- length(hgt) n [1] 5 # Calculate standard error se.hgt &lt;- sd.hgt/sqrt(n) se.hgt [1] 3.763376 # t-multiplier for 95% CI tmult &lt;- qt(p=0.975, df=4) tmult [1] 2.776445 # Lower limit mean.hgt - (tmult*se.hgt) [1] 147.4512 # Upper limit mean.hgt + (tmult*se.hgt) [1] 168.3488 The above commands illustrate how to construct the confidence intervals from the individual components. However, there is a short cut (isnt there always in R) to obtain a CI. We make use of the t.test function; the t.test function does a lot more than provide confidence intervals (which we will explore in the following chapter) but for now we only want the CI which are given by specifying $conf.int. # 95% CI (default) t.test(x=hgt)$conf.int [1] 147.4512 168.3488 attr(,&quot;conf.level&quot;) [1] 0.95 # 90% CI t.test(x=hgt, conf.level=0.90)$conf.int [1] 149.8771 165.9229 attr(,&quot;conf.level&quot;) [1] 0.9 # 99% CI t.test(x=hgt, conf.level=0.99)$conf.int [1] 140.5731 175.2269 attr(,&quot;conf.level&quot;) [1] 0.99 Q7.1 A researcher was interested in the typical size of trees (measured as diameter at breast height, dbh) of a particular species in a forest. Data on dbh (in cm) had been collected on a sample of 50 trees. The mean dbh was 15.3 cm and the standard deviation was 30 cm. a. What is the standard error of the mean? b. Which of the following multipliers should be used for a 90% confidence interval? qt(p=0.90, df=49) [1] 1.299069 qnorm(0.05) [1] -1.644854 qt(p=0.95, df=49) [1] 1.676551 qt(p=0.975, df=49) [1] 2.009575 c. Calculate a 90% confidence interval for the mean. d. Interpret the confidence interval. Q7.2 A study of birth weight was conducted in San Francisco, US. The summary statistics of weights of babies for the group of non-smoking mothers are as follows: \\(n=742\\), \\(\\hat \\mu = 123.05\\) ounces and \\(s = 17.4\\) ounces. Calculate a 95% confidence interval for the mean; the sample size is large and so assume that the \\(t\\) multiplier is 1.96. The full data set can be found here. 7.3 Difference between two group means Sometimes we want to compare two means, for example the mean blood pressure of patients that have received one of two treatments or the mean yield of tomato plants grown in one of two varieties of potting compost. Hence, we are interested in the difference between the two means and want to find a confidence interval for the difference. The process is very similar to that described previously. Assume we have two groups, which we call \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), and sample means have been obtained, \\(\\hat \\mu_A\\) and \\(\\hat \\mu_B\\). The difference between the sample means is simply given by \\[\\textrm{difference } A - B = \\hat \\mu_A - \\hat \\mu_B\\] If this difference is zero (or very close to zero), then it likely that there is no real difference between these two groups. However, if it is not zero there are two possible alternatives: the two samples are from the same parent population and the difference is due to sampling variability, or the two samples are from different populations and so there is a difference beyond any sampling variability. The phrase different populations is used here to refer to parent populations that have different population means, however, we also need to consider whether the parent populations have different standard deviations; as we shall see, this is taken account of when considering the precision of the estimate of the difference. In the next chapter we look at formal statistical tests to determine between the two alternatives described above but here we want to find an interval around the estimate of the difference that we are confident (to some level) contains the true difference. The confidence interval for the difference in the means is given by: \\[(\\hat \\mu_A - \\hat \\mu_B) \\pm t_{(1-(\\alpha/2), n-1)}se(\\hat \\mu_A - \\hat \\mu_B)\\] where \\(se(\\hat \\mu_A - \\hat \\mu_B)\\) is the standard error of the difference. The standard error of the difference is obtained by combining the uncertainty of the two sample estimates and the calculation depends on whether the variability of the two groups can be assumed to be the same (or very similar) or not. Q7.3 According to an advertising campaign, batteries from brand \\(A\\) last longer than batteries from brand \\(B\\). In order to compare the two brands we select a random sample of 90 brand \\(A\\) batteries and 60 brand \\(B\\) batteries. The sample of brand \\(A\\) batteries run continuously for a total of 4451 minutes with a sample standard deviation of 6.32 minutes. The sample of brand \\(B\\) batteries run continuously for a total of 2763 minutes with a sample standard deviation of 3.31 minutes. Assume that the data are normally distributed. Find estimates for \\(\\hat \\mu_A\\) and \\(\\hat \\mu_B\\), the mean running time of a battery from brand \\(A\\) and brand \\(B\\), respectively. Hence find an estimate for the difference in mean running time between the two brands. 7.3.1 Assuming equal standard deviations of the two groups If we can assume that the two groups have the same variability, we pool the information on variability (quantified by the sample standard deviations) to generate an estimate of the pooled variability. The standard error of the difference in sample means is the pooled estimate of the common standard deviation (\\(s_p\\)) (assuming that the variances in the populations are similar) computed as the weighted average of the standard deviations in the samples, \\[se(\\hat{\\mu_A} - \\hat{\\mu_B})=s_p\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n_A} + \\frac{1}{n_B}}\\] where \\(s_p\\) is the pooled standard deviation and is found as follows: \\[ s_p = \\sqrt{\\frac{(n_A-1)s_A^2 + (n_B-1)s_B^2}{n_A + n_B -2}}\\] The pooled degrees of freedom are given by \\(df=(n_A + n_B - 2)\\). These degrees of freedom are then used to find the multiplier \\(t_{(1-(\\alpha/2), df)}\\). This specification for the standard error and degrees of freedom are only appropriate when the two groups have equal standard deviations. Example We continue to look at data collected from the observational study of birth weights introduced in Q7.2. In total, 1236 women were enrolled in the study and the participants came from a wide range of economic, social and educational backgrounds. We want to calculate a 95% confidence interval for the difference between the means for the mothers who smoked and mothers who did not smoke. The summary data are provided in Table 7.1. Table 7.1: Summary of birth weight data for the smoking and non-smoking groups (units are ounces); n is sample size and SD is the standard deviation. Smoking n Mean SD No 742 123.05 17.4 Yes 484 114.11 18.1 The estimate for the difference between the non-smoking group (\\(N\\)) and the smoking group (\\(S\\)) is given by \\[\\hat \\mu_N - \\hat \\mu_S = 123.05 - 114.11 = 8.94\\] In this example, the sample standard deviations are very similar and so we will calculate the pooled standard deviation: \\[ s_p = \\sqrt{\\frac{(n_N-1)s_N^2 + (n_S-1)s_S^2}{n_N + n_S -2}}\\] Substituting in the values gives: \\[ s_p = \\sqrt{\\frac{(742-1)17.4^2 + (484-1)18.1^2}{742 + 484 -2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{382580.8}{1224}} = 17.68\\] Thus, the standard error is \\[se(\\hat{\\mu}_N - \\hat{\\mu}_S)=s_p\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n_N} + \\frac{1}{n_S}} = 17.68 \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{742} + \\frac{1}{484}} = 1.033\\] The degrees of freedom are \\[df = 742 + 484 - 2 = 1224\\] The next component of the confidence interval is the multiplier \\(t_{(1-\\frac{\\alpha}{2}, df)}\\). For a 95% confidence interval, \\(\\alpha=0.05\\) and so we want the quantile associated with \\(t_{(0.975,df=1224)}\\). The degrees of freedom are large and so the relevant \\(t\\) distribution will be very similar to the normal distribution; the actual value of the multiplier is 1.9619. Thus the 95% confidence interval is given by \\[8.94 \\pm 1.9619 \\times 1.033 \\] \\[8.94 \\pm 2.027\\] which results in an interval 6.91 to 10.97 ounces. This interval indicates that we can be 95% confident that, on average, a baby with a non-smoking mother is likely to be about 7 to 11 ounces heavier than a baby with a mother who smokes. 7.3.1.1 Doing this in R Again we can call on the t.test function to calculate a CI for the difference between two sample means. In the code below, the birth weights for non-smokers and smokers have been stored in objects called grpN and grpS, respectively. # 95% CI t.test(x=grpN, y=grpS, var.equal=TRUE)$conf.int [1] 6.911199 10.964133 attr(,&quot;conf.level&quot;) [1] 0.95 Q7.4 For the details of battery running times provided in Q7.3, calculate the standard error (assuming the standard deviations are equal) for the difference in mean running time and hence, using the following information, calculate a 95% confidence interval for the difference in means. qt(p=0.975, df=148) [1] 1.976122 7.3.2 Assuming unequal standard deviations of the two groups If the standard deviations of the two groups cannot be assumed to be equal, then to accurately describe the differences we need to alter the standard error and degrees of freedom calculations. This standard error formula is: \\[se(\\hat{\\mu}_A - \\hat{\\mu}_B)= \\sqrt{\\frac{{s_A}^2}{{n_A}} + \\frac{{s_B}^2}{{n_B}}}\\] To calculate the degrees of freedom when doing the calculation by hand, use the minimum value out of \\(n_A-1\\) and \\(n_B -1\\): \\[df = Min(n_A-1, n_B -1)\\] In computing packages, the more exact (but also more tricky to calculate by hand) Welch-Satterthwaite equation is used: \\[df_w = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{s_A^2}{n_A} + \\frac{s_B^2}{n_B}\\right)^2}{\\frac{s_A^4}{n_A^2(n_A-1)} + \\frac{s_A^4}{n_A^2(n_A-1)}}\\] The Welch-Satterthwaite approximation for df (\\(df_w\\)) is always smaller than the degrees of freedom under equal standard deviation, so for the same \\(\\alpha\\) level, the multiplier will be wider. We will investigate the effects of using this more exact formula further in the computer practical associated with this chapter. Example Using the summary data in Table 7.1, we calculate the 95% confidence interval for the difference in means using the standard error formula that should be used if we cannot assume that the standard deviations of the two groups are the same. The standard error formula, assuming that the standard deviations of the two groups are not equal is: \\[se(\\hat{\\mu}_N - \\hat{\\mu}_S)= \\sqrt{\\frac{{s_N}^2}{{n_N}} + \\frac{{s_S}^2}{{n_S}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{17.4^2}{742} + \\frac{18.1^2}{484}} = 1.04\\] Since we are doing this calculation by hand the following formula is used to obtain the degrees of freedom. \\[df = Min(742-1, 484-1) = 483\\] This results in a multiplier of 1.965, thus, the 95% confidence is given by \\[8.94 \\pm 1.965 \\times 1.04\\] which results in an interval (6.90, 10.98), hence we can be 95% confident that the difference in birth weights between the smoking and non-smoking mothers is between 6.9 and 11 ounces. This is generally the approach that should be used to obtain the confidence interval because the previous approach should only be used if it can be assumed that the population standard deviations (which we generally dont know) are equal. 7.3.2.1 Doing this in R The assumption that the standard deviations are unequal is specified by default (with the var.equal=FALSE) but it is useful to include this argument for clarity. # 95% CI t.test(x=grpN, y=grpS, var.equal=FALSE)$conf.int [1] 6.89385 10.98148 attr(,&quot;conf.level&quot;) [1] 0.95 Q7.5 Using the information in Q7.3, calculate the standard error for the difference in mean running times assuming that the standard deviations are not equal and hence calculate the 95% confidence interval. Calculate the degrees of freedom and select the correct multiplier from the following information. qt(0.975, df=59) [1] 2.000995 qt(0.975, df=148) [1] 1.976122 7.4 Empirical (bootstrap-based) confidence intervals In the calculation of confidence intervals so far we have relied on the CLT. In some circumstances, for example if the sample size is very small or the wider (or parent) population is very skewed, we may not be able to safely assume that the distribution of the sample mean is approximately normal. In such cases, the confidence interval may not capture the true parameter with the required level of confidence and so an alternative method for calculating confidence intervals may be more appropriate. An empirical (also called non-parametric or bootstrap) approach is a useful alternative to obtaining a confidence interval. Assume we want to obtain a CI for a sample mean, then the empirical, bootstrap approach is as follows: Select \\(n\\) values at random and with replacement from our original sample of \\(n\\) values. If we have 100 values in the original sample, we randomly select a sample of 100 values. Sampling with replacement, means some of the observations in the original data may be selected several times and other observations not selected at all. Calculate the mean for this generated sample. Repeat steps 1 and 2 many times (e.g. at least 1000 times). For example, if we took 1000 samples each with \\(n=100\\), this would give us a set of 1000 mean values. Examine the distribution of these sample estimates and locate the values which define the central 95% of the values in this distribution (whatever its shape) (i.e. the 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles). These are called percentile confidence intervals. This method has the advantage that, it side-steps the assumption that the distribution of sample estimates is normally distributed and simply locates the central 95% of the sample estimates. it can be used to obtain confidence intervals for the median or a difference between means, or any other statistic of interest. However, this approach can be computationally intensive, and because of the random nature it may not always provide the desired coverage (e.g. the intervals may be too small or too large and may not capture the parameter of interest with the desired confidence). To illustrate this approach we will use it to find a confidence interval for the mean weights of babies described in Q7.2. To discover more about the bootstrap then see (Davison and Hinckley 1997). 7.4.0.1 Doing this in R The code below shows the steps involved to generate a bootstrap-based confidence interval for the mean weights of babies born to non-smoking mothers. The numbers relate to the steps outlined above. The weights are stored in an object called grpN. To repeatedly perform the same commands a for loop is used to generate samples and calculate the sample mean; the commands within {} are repeated B times with the index i starting at 1 and increasing by 1 each time the loop is repeated. # R code to obtain a bootstrap confidence intervals for density # Number of bootstraps B &lt;- 1000 # Number of observations n &lt;- length(grpN) # Create object to store bootstrap sample means res1 &lt;- rep(NA, B) # 3.

Obtain central 95 percentiles for CI quantile(res1, probs=c(0.025, 0.975)) 2.5% 97.5% 121.7339 124.2144 Creating a function If a series of commands are being used repeatedly (as in steps 1 and 2 in the code above), it often makes sense to combine them into a function. This is done in the code below. samplemean.f &lt;- function(sampdata=data, do.replace=TRUE) { # Function to generate a sample and calculate the mean # Arguments: # sampdata = original sample # do.replace = indicates whether sampling is with replacement, or not n &lt;- length(sampdata) bootsamp &lt;- sample(x=sampdata, size=n, replace=do.replace) bootmean &lt;- mean(bootsamp) # Return mean bootmean } Defining a function follows certain conventions: the first line assigns the function contained in the function to a name (in this case samplemean.f) all arguments required for the function are specified at the top, including any default values, all function commands are within the parentheses {} the last line returns the result of the function. Having created this function, we can amend the bootstrap code to include it: # Number of bootstraps B &lt;- 1000 # Create object to store sample means res1 &lt;- rep(NA, B) # 3. Bootstrap loops for (i in 1:B) { # 1. and 2. Obtain sample means with function res1[i] &lt;- samplemean.f(sampdata=grpN, do.replace=TRUE) } # 4. Obtain 95 percentiles for CI quantile(res1, probs=c(0.025, 0.975)) 2.5% 97.5% 121.7559 124.2779 How does this empirical CI compare to that using the conventional method? The CIs obtained from the two methods should be similar; the sample size is fairly large and the heights are approximately normally distributed. Bootstrapping the easy way! The commands above have been included to illustrate all the steps in a bootstrap approach. However, in practice we dont need to write the code to perform such a bootstrap (unless you want to) because R contains a suite of functions which perform these commands; these require two additional libraries to be installed and then loaded into the R workspace with the library function. The process requires two stages; one to generate the distribution of sample estimates and the second to obtain the confidence interval from the distribution. The code below generates a CI for mean weight of babies from non-smoking mothers. The oneboot function generates the sample estimates and requires 3 arguments to be specified: data - the data to be bootstrapped, in this example, the weights are stored in an object called grpN, FUN - the name of the function used to calculate the statistic of interest (in this case, we want the mean but the median or sd, for example, could also be used), and R - the number of repetitions. The boot.ci function calculates the CI with the specified level of confidence. # Bootstrapping CI using built-in functions # Generate bootstrap sample means library(simpleboot) bsmeans &lt;- one.boot(data=grpN, FUN=mean, R=1000) # Obtain CI library(boot) boot.ci(bsmeans, conf=0.95, type=&quot;perc&quot;) BOOTSTRAP CONFIDENCE INTERVAL CALCULATIONS Based on 1000 bootstrap replicates CALL : boot.ci(boot.out = bsmeans, conf = 0.95, type = &quot;perc&quot;) Intervals : Level Percentile 95% (121.8, 124.3 ) Calculations and Intervals on Original Scale The CI is similar to those calculated previously but due to the random selection of data, the results from a bootstrap may be slightly different each time the code is executed. The code below generates a CI for difference in mean weight of babies from non-smoking and smoking mothers using the two.boot function. The arguments are: sample1 and sample2 - the two groups of data, in this example, the weights are stored in objects called grpN and grpS, FUN - the name of the function used to calculate the statistic of interest (in this case, we want the difference between the means), and R - the number of repetitions. # Bootstrapping CI using built-in functions # Generate bootstrap sample means library(simpleboot) bsdiffs &lt;- two.boot(sample1=grpN, sample2=grpS, FUN=mean, R=1000) # Obtain CI library(boot) boot.ci(bsdiffs, conf=0.95, type=&quot;perc&quot;) BOOTSTRAP CONFIDENCE INTERVAL CALCULATIONS Based on 1000 bootstrap replicates CALL : boot.ci(boot.out = bsdiffs, conf = 0.95, type = &quot;perc&quot;) Intervals : Level Percentile 95% ( 6.845, 10.975 ) Calculations and Intervals on Original Scale 7.5 Confidence intervals for other sample statistics The methods described in this chapter can be adapted to find confidence intervals for other sample statistics, for example the median and variance. As previously mentioned, bootstrap confidence intervals can easily be obtained for these sample statistics in R by changing the FUN argument in the one.boot or two.boot functions. Parametric confidence intervals can also be obtained in a similar manner to that of the sample mean. Rather than using the \\(t\\) distribution other statistical distributions are used; for example, for a CI for the variance a \\(\\chi^2\\) distribution is used - this distribution is described in Chapter 12. A brief description of a CI for the median is given below. In a later chapter we look at confidence intervals for sample proportions. 7.5.0.1 Confidence interval for the median For the median, the confidence interval is obtained slightly differently and because we are not making any assumptions about the distribution (e.g. that it is symmetric), the CI is approximate. Similar to the median, the CI is based on ranked values. The ranked value for the lower 95% CI (for a sample of size \\(n\\)) is given by \\[\\frac{n}{2} - \\frac{1.96 \\sqrt{n}}{2}\\] and the ranked value for the upper 95% CI is given by \\[1 + \\frac{n}{2} + \\frac{1.96 \\sqrt{n}}{2}\\] The CI is then obtained by finding the observed values associated with these ranked values. Example The median weight of babies is 120 ounces. The sample size is 1236 and so the median was the average of the 618th and 619th ranked values. The ranked value for the lower 95% CI is found from \\[\\frac{1236}{2} - \\frac{1.96 \\sqrt{1236}}{2} = 618 - 34.45 = 583.55\\] The ranked value for the upper 95% CI is found from \\[1 + \\frac{1236}{2} + \\frac{1.96 \\sqrt{1236}}{2} = 1 + 618 + 34.45 = 653.45\\] There are no ranked values 583.55 and 653.45 and so these values simply get rounded to the nearest integer, hence, the 584th and 653rd ranked observations provide the confidence interval, which in this case is 119 to 121 ounces. Note that the confidence interval may not be symmetrical about the median because it is based on ranked values. 7.5.0.2 Doing this in R To obtain a CI for the median, we again make use of a function, wilcox.test, that we will come across again later in the course but for now we use it to harvest the CI. # Calculate median median(baby$bwt) [1] 120 # 95% CI for median wilcox.test(x=baby$bwt, conf.int=TRUE)$conf.int [1] 119 121 attr(,&quot;conf.level&quot;) [1] 0.95 An alternative method (there are others) requires the package DescTools to be installed and loaded and then the function medianCI can be used: # Load library(already installed) library(DescTools) # 95% CI for median MedianCI(baby$bwt) median lwr.ci upr.ci 120 119 121 attr(,&quot;conf.level&quot;) [1] 0.9503555 7.6 Summary This chapter has illustrated that sample estimates, such as the sample mean, follow statistical distributions and we know something about the location and spread of these sampling distributions based on the information in the sample (i.e. sample size, mean and standard deviation). This information can be used to obtain a plausible range of values for the true, but unknown, population mean: a confidence interval. 7.6.1 Learning outcomes In this chapter you have seen: that the sampling distribution of a sample estimate is normally distributed which has led to the Central Limit Theorem, the calculation of confidence intervals, for both a sample mean and the difference between two sample means, relying on the CLT, and the calculation of bootstrap-based confidence intervals, and that confidence intervals can be obtained for other sample statistics. 7.7 Answers Q7.1 a.

Substituting in these values, the 95% confidence interval for the difference in mean running time is now between 1.8 and 5 minutes: \\[3.41 \\pm 2.001 \\times 0.792\\] \\[ 1.825 \\quad ; \\quad 4.995\\] References "],["hypothtests.html", "Chapter 8 Hypothesis Tests 8.1 Introduction 8.2 Two sample \\(t\\) test 8.3 Paired \\(t\\) test 8.4 \\(t\\) test assumptions 8.5 Non-parametric alternative to \\(t\\) tests 8.6 Practical significance versus statistical significance 8.7 Summary 8.8 Answers", " Chapter 8 Hypothesis Tests The value for which \\(P\\)=0.05, or 1 in 20, is 1.96 or nearly 2; it is convenient to take this point as a limit in judging whether a deviation ought to be considered significant or not.

Using this criterion we should be led to follow up a false indication only once in 22 trials, even if the statistics were the only guide available.

A Fisher, 1971. 8.1 Introduction A confidence interval provides a plausible range of values for an unknown parameter (e.g. the population mean). A hypothesis test is conducted to investigate a question e.g. does the application of fertilizer increase crop yield, does a new drug reduce blood pressure compared to a standard drug? These might be termed research hypotheses - the question that the study is designed to answer. In a one sample \\(t\\) test, a sample mean is compared to a known or hypothesised value. A two sample \\(t\\) test is used to determine if two population means are equal. In hypothesis testing, we try to determine the strength of evidence for a particular value given the data - this can be quantified by a probability, the \\(p\\)-value. Hypothesis tests such as \\(t\\) tests rely on assumptions but if these assumptions are not valid, alternative, non-parametric methods can be used. This chapter describes the different types of hypotheses a one sample, two sample and paired \\(t\\) tests the differences between one- and two-tailed tests using a \\(p\\)-value or fixed significance level to make conclusions, non-parametric alternatives to \\(t\\) tests and statistical and practical significance. 8.1.1 Types of hypotheses A study is generally designed with a research hypothesis in mind. To test a research hypothesis, two further hypotheses are required and these are defined with a specific format; a null hypothesis and an alternative hypothesis. The null hypothesis (denoted by \\(H_0\\)) is the hypothesis that is tested and is very specific. In a one sample \\(t\\) test it specifies that there is no difference between the true mean (\\(\\mu\\)) and the hypothesised value (say \\(\\mu_0\\)). This is represented mathematically as: \\[H_0: \\mu = \\mu_0\\] or equivalently, \\[H_0: \\mu - \\mu_0 = 0\\] Example We wish to determine whether a sample of baby weights could have been generated from a population with a mean of 120 ounces; this is the research hypothesis to be tested. The null hypothesis would be \\[H_0: \\mu = 120\\] The alternative hypothesis (denoted by \\(H_1\\) or \\(H_A\\)) could take several forms. Firstly, we could state that the true mean is not equal to the hypothesised value: \\[H_1: \\mu \\ne \\mu_0\\] This is called a two-tailed test because \\(\\mu\\) could be either larger or smaller than \\(\\mu_0\\) - the direction of any difference is not important. We could, however, be more precise and state a direction where we think the difference will lie, for example: \\[H_1: \\mu &lt; \\mu_0\\] or alternatively: \\[H_1: \\mu &gt; \\mu_0\\] These are called one-tailed tests because the direction of the difference is important. For both one- and two-tailed tests, the null hypothesis will remain the same. The alternative hypothesis for a two-tailed test of the birth weights will be: \\[H_1: \\mu \\ne 120\\] The example we have considered so far is a one sample test because we have one sample of data and we which to know whether it could have been generated from a process with a particular mean, e.g. 120 ounces. We might be interested in determining whether data in two groups could have been generated from processes with the same or different means - this is a two sample test because we are comparing two samples, or groups. Assuming two groups, \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), the null hypothesis will be: \\[H_0: \\mu_A = \\mu_B\\] or \\[H_0: \\mu_A - \\mu_B = 0\\] Similar to a one sample test, the alternative hypotheses could be that the two means are not the same (two-tailed test): \\[H_1: \\mu_A \\ne \\mu_B\\] or the means are different in some direction (one-tailed tests): \\[H_1: \\mu_A &lt; \\mu_B\\] \\[H_1: \\mu_A &gt; \\mu_B\\] Having defined the test hypotheses, a test statistic is calculated and the strength of evidence for this statistic, assuming the null hypothesis is true, is quantified. 8.1.2 How do hypothesis tests work? Hypothesis tests work by comparing an estimate obtained from the data (we call this a data-estimate) with what we expect to find assuming that \\(H_0\\) is true. The basic formulation of the test statistic (\\(t_{stat}\\)) is: \\[t_{stat}=\\frac{\\textrm{data-estimate - hypothesised value}}{\\textrm{standard error of data-estimate}}\\] Evidence against the null hypothesis is provided by a large discrepancy between this data-estimate and the hypothesised value given by \\(H_0\\). If \\(H_0\\) is true, we expect the data-estimate and the hypothesised value to be similar and any difference is due to sampling variation alone. However, detecting a difference from a particular value depends on the variability of the data and this is quantified by the standard error of the data-estimate. Consider a two sample test, where we want to decide whether any observed difference between the two group means is due to a real difference between the groups or whether it is due to sampling variability. Figure 8.1 illustrates two sets of data: group 1 has a mean of 30 and group 2 has a mean of 20; the standard deviation in the left hand panel is 2 for both groups and the standard deviation in the right hand panel is 8. A real difference between means seems: more compelling if the values within groups are tightly clustered (left-hand plot, Figure 8.1). less convincing if the values within each group are very variable (right-hand plot, Figure 8.1). If there are no differences between group means (i.e. the null hypothesis is true) then any observed differences are likely to be small compared with the within-group variability (i.e. similar to the right-hand plot, Figure 8.1). Figure 8.1: Box plots illustrating the distribution of data for two groups where the variability in the data is low (left) and high (right). We use the test statistic to quantify how much our data-estimate differs from the value in the null hypothesis taking into account the variability in the data. The formula for calculating the test statistic varies across data types and the nature of the test. In this chapter we consider one and two sample \\(t\\) tests to compare sample means; proportions are considered in a later chapter. 8.1.3 One sample \\(t\\) test In a one sample \\(t\\) test we compare the data-estimate to the hypothesised value; the \\(t\\) test statistic is given by: \\[t_{stat}=\\frac{\\hat \\mu - \\mu_0}{se(\\hat \\mu)}\\] where \\(\\hat \\mu\\) is the sample mean and \\(se(\\hat \\mu)\\) is the standard error of the sample mean. Lets return to the example where we want to determine whether the sample of baby weights could have been generated from a population with a mean of 120 ounces. As a reminder, the null hypothesis is: \\(H_0\\): \\({\\mu} = 120\\) We will consider a two-tailed test and so the alternative hypothesis is: \\(H_1\\): \\({\\mu} \\neq 120\\) The sample statistics are: \\(\\hat\\mu\\)=119.5769, \\(s\\)=18.236 and \\(n\\)=1236. Substituting in these values we can calculate the standard error and test statistic. The standard error is given by: \\[se(\\hat\\mu) = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}} = \\frac{18.24}{\\sqrt{1236}} = 0.519\\] The test statistic is, therefore, \\[t_{stat}=\\frac{\\hat{\\mu} - 120}{se(\\hat{\\mu})} = \\frac{119.577 - 120}{0.519} = -0.815\\] If \\(H_0\\) is true, the test statistic (\\(t_{stat}\\)) should be close to zero because the difference between the test statistic and the hypothesised value is small. If \\(H_0\\) is false, the test statistic should be large (positive or negative) because the difference between the test statistic and the hypothesised value is large. To decide if a test statistic is large under the null hypothesis, we compare the test statistic to a reference distribution and, not surprisingly for a \\(t\\) test, we use the \\(t\\) distribution. The shape of the \\(t\\) distribution depends on the degrees of freedom and for a one sample \\(t\\) test the degrees of freedom (\\(df\\)) are given by \\(df = n - 1\\). Using this reference distribution we can determine what values might typically arise. Having found the test statistic for the one sample test of baby weights, we obtain the associated reference \\(t\\) distribution. The sample size is 1236, and so \\(df = 1236 - 1 = 1235\\), hence, the reference distribution is a \\(t_{df=1235}\\) distribution (Figure 8.2). This figure shows that values close to zero are likely to occur and values smaller than -2, or greater than 2, are unlikely. Where the test statistic lies on the reference distribution indicates how typical it is given the null hypothesis. The reference distribution can be used in two ways to determine the strength of evidence for the null hypothesis: by obtaining an exact \\(p\\)-value for the test statistic or using a pre-determined significance level. 8.1.3.1 Determining an exact \\(p\\)-value A \\(p\\)-value is the probability of observing a test statistic at least as extreme as the one observed, given the null hypothesis is true. Thus, a test statistic close to zero would be likely to occur if was no difference between the data-estimate and the hypothesised value (other than sampling variability) and thus the probability of observing such a value would be high. a large, absolute value of the test statistic would be likely if there was a real difference between the data-estimate and the hypothesised value (over and above sampling variability) and thus the probability of observing such a value would be small. A mathematical representation of the \\(p\\)-value for a two-tailed test is: \\[Pr(T \\le -|t_{stat}|) + Pr(T \\ge |t_{stat}|) \\] where \\(T\\) is a random variable distributed as \\(t_{df}\\). Using the \\(t_{df=1235}\\) distribution, the \\(p\\)-value associated with the test statistic of -0.815 can be obtained (Figure 8.2). We want the probability of a value smaller than -0.815 and the probability of a value greater than 0.815 (i.e. the areas in both tails of the distribution): \\[Pr(T \\le -0.815) + Pr(T \\ge 0.815) \\] The first part of this expression (i.e. \\(Pr(T \\le -0.815)\\)) is the cumulative distribution function and because the distribution is symmetric we can easily find the value \\(Pr(T \\ge 0.815)\\). Figure 8.2: Reference \\(t\\) distribution for one sample example, \\(t_{df=1235}\\). The blue shaded region indicates areas more extreme than the test statistic (for a two-tailed test). The blue shaded area on Figure 8.2 is a substantial proportion of the total area and is, in fact, 0.415 (= 0.2076 + 0.2076) of the area, hence the \\(p\\)-value is 0.415. What does this \\(p\\)-value indicate about how likely a test statistic of -0.815 is? The \\(p\\)-value measures the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis and, typically, \\(H_0\\) is only rejected when the \\(p\\)-value is really small. What is classed as small? Common threshold values are 0.1, 0.05 or 0.01 and they can be translated as follows (Wild and Seber 1999): Approximate \\(p\\)-value Translation &gt;0.10 No evidence against \\(H_0\\) 0.05 Weak evidence against \\(H_0\\) 0.01 Strong evidence against \\(H_0\\) \\(\\le\\) 0.001 Very strong evidence against \\(H_0\\) A \\(p\\)-value of 0.415 is pretty large, much larger than any of the values which provide evidence against \\(H_0\\) (shown in the table above). Hence, we conclude that the test statistic is consistent with \\(H_0\\); we are pretty likely to observe a test statistic of -0.815, or one more extreme. These data do not provide evidence to reject the null hypothesis and the sample of baby weights could come from an underlying population with a mean of 120 ounces. Example The average age of the mothers in the sample (of size \\(n=1236\\)) from the US was 27.255 years with a standard deviation of 5.7814 years. The average age of first time mothers in the UK 2017 was 28.8 (The original data are here). Is there evidence to suggest that the age of mothers differ between the US and UK? We assume that the age of mothers in the UK was obtained from a census (and so there is no uncertainty). The null hypothesis is: \\[H_0: \\mu_{US} = 28.8\\] and since there is no reason to suspect that the average age in the US is either higher or lower than in the UK, we consider a two-tailed test and so the alternative hypothesis is: \\[H_1: \\mu_{US} \\ne 28.8\\] The standard error is given by: \\[se(\\hat \\mu_{US}) = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}} = \\frac{5.7814}{\\sqrt{1236}} = 0.1644\\] and thus the test statistic is: \\[ t_{stat} = \\frac{\\hat \\mu_{US} - 28.8}{se(\\hat \\mu_{US})} = \\frac{27.255 - 28.8}{0.1664} = -9.285\\] We compare this to a reference distribution - since the sample size is 1236, the degrees of freedom for the reference distribution will be 1235. This is the distribution plotted in Figure 8.2 (since the sample size is the same as the sample of baby weights) and shows that a value of -9.285 will be out in the left hand tail (so much so that it is not even displayed on the \\(x\\)-axis scale.) In fact, the probability of obtaining a value as extreme, or more extreme, than -9.285 (i.e. \\(Pr(T \\le -0.9285)\\)) is pretty much zero and even when added to the probability in right hand tail (i.e. \\(Pr(T \\ge 0.9285)\\)) the \\(p\\)-value is approximately zero. Translating this value using the table above, there is strong evidence to reject \\(H_0\\) and conclude that the average age of the US mothers is not from a population with a mean of 28.8 years. 8.1.3.2 Using a fixed significance level Some studies use a (pre-determined) fixed significance level; the evidence for the null hypothesis is determined with a 5% significance level, for example. We find a critical value from the reference distribution based on the significance level and compare the test statistic to this critical value. Lets return to the reference distribution for the baby weights and assume a fixed significance level of 5%; this is a two-tailed test (as specified in the alternative hypothesis) and so we want to find the quantile (the critical value, \\(t_{crit}\\)) such that: \\[Pr(T \\le -|t_{crit}|) + Pr(T \\ge |t_{crit}|) = 0.05\\] In Figure 8.3, the critical value, \\(t_{crit}\\) is 1.96 (i.e. the red shaded area is 5% of the total area) and we can see that the test statistic does not fall within the red shaded region. Hence, the conclusion is the same as before, there is no evidence to reject the null hypothesis, testing at a 5% significance level. A test statistic falling within the red shaded region would be sufficiently unlikely (based on the significance level) to have occurred if the null hypothesis was true, hence, providing evidence to reject the null hypothesis. Figure 8.3: Reference \\(t\\) distribution for one sample example, \\(t_{df=1235}\\). The red shaded region indicates areas more extreme than the critical value. The blue dashed line indicates the test statistic. This method of obtaining a critical value based on a fixed significance level and comparing it to the test statistic was used when making a decision regarding the null hypothesis was limited to looking up critical values in statistical tables. It is still frequently practised - it is commonplace to see the phrase testing at a significance level of  in statistical reports. In more recent times, when access to computing power and statistical packages is commonplace, it is now easy to perform a test and obtain an exact \\(p\\)-value and indeed many computer packages routinely provide exact \\(p\\)-values in output. 8.1.3.3 Doing this in R The function t.test was previously introduced to calculate a confidence interval; now we use it to perform a one sample \\(t\\) test on the baby weights. These data are stored in an object called baby and the weights are in a column called bwt. For a one sample test, the hypothesised value (mu) is specified and a two-tailed test (i.e. \\(H_1: \\mu \\ne 120\\)) is performed by default. # One sample t test t.test(x=baby$bwt, mu=120) One Sample t-test data: baby$bwt t = -0.81574, df = 1235, p-value = 0.4148 alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 120 95 percent confidence interval: 118.5592 120.5945 sample estimates: mean of x 119.5769 The output provides information about the test; the test statistic, degrees of freedom and exact \\(p\\)-value, what alternative hypothesis has been specified, and the sample mean and 95% confidence interval for the sample mean. The t.test function provides the \\(p\\)-value as part of the output, but we can also find this value from the pt function. In the command below, two alternative methods are used to find it. # Finding the exact p-value # 1. Calculate area in lower tail and multiply by 2 pt(q=-0.815, df=1235) * 2 [1] 0.4152294 # 2. Calculate area in both tails and add pt(q=-0.815, df=1235) + pt(q=0.815, df=1235, lower.tail=FALSE) [1] 0.4152294 The t.test function does not provide the critical value but this can be obtained from the qt function: for a two-tailed test, the significance level is distributed equally between the two tails. For a significance level of 5%, there will be 2.5% in each tail; by default, the area in the lower tail is provided. # Left hand (lower) tail qt(p=0.025, df=1235) [1] -1.961887 # Right hand (upper) tail qt(p=0.025, df=1235, lower.tail=FALSE) [1] 1.961887 Q8.1 The weight of a chocolate bar was supposed to be 100 grams.

What command would you use to calculate the exact \\(p\\)-value associated with the test statistic? 8.2 Two sample \\(t\\) test In a two sample \\(t\\) test, we are interested in comparing means of continuous data from two groups (e.g. groups \\(A\\) and \\(B\\)). The test statistic is used to quantify the discrepancy between the data-estimate and the null hypothesis (i.e. no differences between the two means): \\[H_0 : \\mu_A = \\mu_B\\] or equivalently, \\[H_0 : \\mu_A - \\mu_B = 0\\] The alternative hypothesis for a two-tailed test will be: \\[H_1 : \\mu_A - \\mu_B \\ne 0\\] The test statistic is given by: \\[t_{stat} = \\frac{(\\hat{\\mu}_A - \\hat{\\mu}_B) - 0}{se(\\hat{\\mu}_A - \\hat{\\mu}_B)}\\] Example We continue to look at data collected from the observational study of birth weights introduced previously. We want to test whether babies born to mothers who did not smoke are heavier in weight compared to babies born to mothers who smoked. The summary data are provided in Table 8.1. Table 8.1: Summary of birth weight data for the smoking and non-smoking groups (units are ounces). Smoking n Mean SD No 742 123.05 17.4 Yes 484 114.11 18.1 We define the null hypothesis for the two groups, smokers (\\(S\\)) and non-smokers (\\(N\\)) as: \\[H_0: \\mu_N - \\mu_S = 0\\] The alternative hypothesis will be one-tailed because we want to see if babies in the non-smoking group are heavier than the smoking group babies. \\[H_1: \\mu_N &gt; \\mu_S\\] or \\[H_1: \\mu_N - \\mu_S &gt; 0\\] Since we do not want to make the assumption that the standard deviations of the two groups are equal, we will calculate the standard error of the difference from: \\[se(\\hat{\\mu_N} - \\hat{\\mu_S})= \\sqrt{\\frac{{s_N}^2}{{n_N}} + \\frac{{s_S}^2}{{n_S}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{17.4^2}{742} + \\frac{18.1^2}{484}} = 1.042\\] Thus, the test statistic is: \\[t_{stat} = \\frac{(123.05 - 114.11) - 0}{1.042} = 8.583\\] The degrees of freedom (for hand calculation) are given by finding the minimum value (\\(Min\\)) from the sample sizes for the two groups minus one: \\[df = Min(n_N-1, n_S-1) = Min(741, 483) = 483\\] Hence, the reference distribution is \\(t_{df=483}\\) and, because we are conducting a one-tail test, we are only interested in the probability associated with \\(Pr(T \\ge 8.583)\\). Figure 8.4 shows that this probability is going to be very small because the test statistic is in the extreme right hand tail, i.e. the \\(p\\)-value is going to be close to zero. Hence, there is strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the babies from non-smoking mothers are heavier from smoking mothers. Figure 8.4: Reference \\(t\\) distribution for two sample test example, \\(t_{df=483}\\). The red shaded region indicates areas more extreme than the critical value for a one-tailed test. To obtain the critical value associated with a significance level of 5%, we want the area in the right hand tail only - because this is a one-tailed test, i.e. \\(Pr(T &gt; t_{crit}) = 0.05\\); this is the red shaded area in Figure 8.4. The test statistic is much larger than the critical value (\\(t_{crit}=1.65\\)) and thus there is evidence to suggest that the babies born to non-smoking mothers are heavier than babies born to mothers who smoked, testing at a 5% significance level. 8.2.1 Doing this in R To make the code simple, separate objects are created for two groups. By default, a two-tailed test is performed but a one-tailed test can be specified using the alternative argument. Also by default, the standard deviations are assumed to be unequal and the degrees of freedom will be calculated using the Welch-Satterthwaite equation (Chapter 7). # Save objects for two groups grpN &lt;- baby$bwt[baby$smoke==0] grpS &lt;- baby$bwt[baby$smoke==1] # Two sample, one-tailed t test t.test(x=grpN, y=grpS, alternative=&quot;greater&quot;) Welch Two Sample t-test data: grpN and grpS t = 8.5813, df = 1003.2, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16 alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is greater than 0 95 percent confidence interval: 7.222928 Inf sample estimates: mean of x mean of y 123.0472 114.1095 Since a one-tailed test has been specified, only one limit of the confidence interval for the difference in means is provided; in this example it is a plausible value for a lower limit i.e. that the weight of babies born to non-smoking mothers is likely to be at least 7.22 ounces. The \\(p\\)-value in the output is found from: # p-value in upper tail (using the Welch-Satterthwaite df) pt(q=8.5813, df=1003.2, lower.tail=FALSE) [1] 1.762554e-17 The critical value, testing at a significance level of 5% for a one-tailed test, would be found using the following command: # Critical value (using df for hand calculation) # Significance level is 5% for a one-tailed test qt(p=0.05, df=482, lower.tail=FALSE) [1] 1.648021 Q8.2 According to an advertising campaign, batteries from brand \\(A\\) last longer than batteries from brand \\(B\\). State the null and alternative hypotheses required to test this claim and hence, conduct a hypothesis test using the following data using a fixed significance level of 5%. Assume that the data are normally distributed. The following may be of use. qt(p=0.05, df=59, lower.tail=FALSE) [1] 1.671093 Brand n Mean SD A 90 49.5 6.32 B 60 46.1 3.31 Q8.3 An experiment looked at the effect of either a high or low protein diet on female rats. The gains in weight over a period of time were recorded and a two-sample \\(t\\) test was conducted; the R output is shown below. Welch Two Sample t-test data: hi.protein and lo.protein t = 1.9107, df = 13.082, p-value = 0.07821 alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 95 percent confidence interval: -2.469073 40.469073 sample estimates: mean of x mean of y 120 101 a. State the null and alternative hypotheses that have been tested. b. Given that the standard error for the difference in means used in this test was 9.944, explain how the test statistic was calculated. c. Interpret the test results. 8.3 Paired \\(t\\) test A paired \\(t\\) test is used to compare the population means of two groups where the observations in one sample can be paired with an observation in the other sample. An example would be a study where participants are measured before and after a treatment and so the two measurements are not independent since the measurements were taken from the same participants. These types of study can be very useful because using the same participants can eliminate any variation other than the treatment between the two groups. Let \\(x\\) be a measurement before treatment, or some intervention, and \\(y\\) be a measurement after treatment. The difference between the two measurements on each participant \\(i\\) is given by: \\[d_i = x_i - y_i\\] The mean of the difference is calculated, here denoted by \\(\\bar d\\), this essentially reduces the data to one sample; a paired \\(t\\) test is the same as a one sample \\(t\\) test on the differences. The null hypothesis is that the true mean of the differences is equal to zero: \\[H_0: \\mu_d = 0\\] The alternative hypothesis can be specified in several ways depending on whether a one or two-tailed test is required, for example: \\[H_1: \\mu_d \\ne 0\\] \\[H_1: \\mu_d &gt; 0\\] \\[H_1: \\mu_d &lt; 0\\] The test statistic is given by: \\[t_{stat} = \\frac{\\bar d - 0}{se(\\bar d)} \\] The standard error of the differences is: \\[se(\\bar d) = \\frac{s_d}{\\sqrt{n}}\\] where \\(s_d\\) is the sample standard deviation of the differences. Under the null hypothesis, the test statistic follows a \\(t_{df=n-1}\\) distribution and this can be used to obtain a \\(p\\)-value. Example A study tested whether cholesterol level was reduced after using a certain brand of margarine as part of a low cholesterol diet. Eighteen participants incorporated the margarine into their daily diet and their cholesterol levels were measured at the start and after 4 and 8 weeks. Here we compare the cholesterol levels after 4 and 8 weeks (data can be found here). We do not make an assumption about whether cholesterol levels should be higher or lower after 8 weeks and hence use a two-tailed test. The mean and standard deviation of the differences are \\(\\bar d = 0.0628\\) and \\(s_d = 0.0704\\). The test statistic is then: \\[t_{stat} = \\frac{0.0628}{\\frac{0.0704}{\\sqrt{18}}} = 3.78\\] This is compared to a \\(t_{df=17}\\) distribution; Figure 8.5 shows that the test statistic lies in the right hand tail and so the probability of obtaining a value as extreme as this is going to be very small. The critical value is 2.11 and Figure 8.5 shows that the test statistic is much greater than the critical value. Therefore, there is some evidence to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a difference in cholesterol levels between weeks 4 and 8. Figure 8.5: Reference \\(t_{df}=17\\) distribution for paired sample example. The blue dashed line indicates the test statistic and the red shaded region indicates areas more extreme than the critical value (testing at a significance level of 5%. 8.3.1 Doing this in R The t.test function is used to perform a paired \\(t\\) test with an additional argument to indicate that the data are paired observations. In the example below, the cholesterol data have been stored in an object called chol. # Paired t test t.test(chol$After8weeks, chol$After4weeks, paired=TRUE) Paired t-test data: chol$After8weeks and chol$After4weeks t = -3.7809, df = 17, p-value = 0.001491 alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 95 percent confidence interval: -0.09780897 -0.02774658 sample estimates: mean of the differences -0.06277778 The similarity between this approach and using a one sample test of the differences is easily shown: # Calculate the difference diff &lt;- chol$After8weeks - chol$After4weeks # One sample t test of differences t.test(x=diff, mu=0) One Sample t-test data: diff t = -3.7809, df = 17, p-value = 0.001491 alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 0 95 percent confidence interval: -0.09780897 -0.02774658 sample estimates: mean of x -0.06277778 8.4 \\(t\\) test assumptions Both one and two sample \\(t\\) tests are based on assumptions that need to be fulfilled for the results to be reliable. These assumptions are that the data are independent (both within and between groups), and normally distributed. The first assumption can be determined by having knowledge of the data collection procedures and what the data represent. If the sampling units in the groups are paired, then a paired \\(t\\) test can be undertaken. The second assumption can be checked by plotting the data, for example using histograms and boxplots. This will be explored further in the chapter 9. If the data are not normally distributed, then a non-parametric test can be used and so we look at this next. Q8.4 For the test described in Q8.3, as well as an assumption regarding standard deviations of the two groups, state two other assumptions on which this test was based. 8.5 Non-parametric alternative to \\(t\\) tests The \\(t\\) test assumes that the data are normally distributed and, although the test is quite robust if data are not exactly normally distributed (i.e. the test result is still valid), in some situations the data will be skewed or the sample size will be small. In these circumstances, non-parametric, or distribution-free, methods are available. However, these methods still assume that the data are independent within and between groups. To determine if two data samples have the same population mean, the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test is used. 8.5.1 Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test This test is known by various names (e.g. Mann-Whitney, two-sample Wilcoxon). The null hypothesis is that the two groups (say \\(A\\) and \\(B\\)) have the same distributions - represented as \\(H_0: A = B\\). The alternative hypothesis is that there is a shift in the distribution; if there is no reason to suggest a shift to the left or right, the alternative hypothesis will \\(H_1: A \\ne B\\). One-tailed variants (i.e. \\(H_1: A &lt; B\\) or \\(H_1: A &gt; B\\)) can also be tested. Example To illustrate the test procedure, six baby weights from the smoking group and six from the non-smoking group are used. The data in the two groups are Non-smoking (N): 120, 113, 123, 136, 138, 132 Smoking (S): 128, 108, 143, 144, 141, 110 The test statistic is based on sorting the data into order and assigning ranks - the ranks in each group are then added together. The procedure is: Combine the values (weights) from both groups and rank them in order of increasing value. Weight Group Rank 108 S 1 110 S 2 113 N 3 120 N 4 123 N 5 128 S 6 132 N 7 136 N 8 138 N 9 141 S 10 143 S 11 144 S 12 Calculate the sum of ranks for each group: \\[R_N = 3 + 4 + 5 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 36\\] \\[R_S = 1 + 2 + 6 + 10 + 11 + 12 = 42\\] Calculate a test statistic for both groups: \\[W_N = R_N - \\frac{n_N(n_N + 1)}{2} = 36 - \\frac{6 \\times 7}{2} = 15\\] \\[W_S = R_S - \\frac{n_S(n_S + 1)}{2} = 42 - \\frac{6 \\times 7}{2} = 21\\] Either of these values are used as the test statistic - the smaller value is generally used when consulting statistical tables to determine a critical value (There are some statistical tables here) and then the test statistic would be compared to the critical value as described previously. Here, we use R and R uses the test statistic for the first group specified in the command (see below). There are also one sample and paired sample variants of the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test and these are illustrated below. 8.5.1.1 Doing this in R The function is called wilcox.test and, as in the example above, only the first six weights in each group are used. wilcox.test(x=grpN[1:6], y=grpS[1:6]) Wilcoxon rank sum exact test data: grpN[1:6] and grpS[1:6] W = 15, p-value = 0.6991 alternative hypothesis: true location shift is not equal to 0 The \\(p\\)-value is interpreted as before; here it is large and thus provides no evidence to reject the null hypothesis. For large samples, the test statistic \\(W\\) is approximately normally distributed and so the \\(p\\)-value is obtained from the normal distribution and a correction is applied to account for this approximation: we can see this using all the data for the baby weights. wilcox.test(x=grpN, y=grpS) Wilcoxon rank sum test with continuity correction data: grpN and grpS W = 231918, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16 alternative hypothesis: true location shift is not equal to 0 A one sample version is available; here the null hypothesis can be interpreted as the median is equal to some hypothesised value: \\[H_0: \\textrm{median} = \\textrm{median}_0\\] To illustrate the command for the baby weights: wilcox.test(x=baby$bwt, mu=120) Wilcoxon signed rank test with continuity correction data: baby$bwt V = 358753, p-value = 0.7062 alternative hypothesis: true location is not equal to 120 To illustrate a paired sample variant of the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test, we return to the cholesterol data. # Paired sample wilcox.test(x=chol$After4weeks, y=chol$After8weeks, paired=TRUE) Wilcoxon signed rank test with continuity correction data: chol$After4weeks and chol$After8weeks V = 152.5, p-value = 0.003725 alternative hypothesis: true location shift is not equal to 0 8.6 Practical significance versus statistical significance The word significant can often cause confusion - in hypothesis tests a significant result frequently means the \\(p\\)-value is less than 0.05. It does not necessarily imply that the result (for example, a difference between means) is substantial and has practical significance. Indeed we sometimes define the significance as part of our test e.g. 0.05, and another analysis might use a different value to determine significance. To illustrate the practical significance, confidence intervals should be reported along with the test results. Statistical significance: relates to the existence of an effect, it can be found with small differences if the sample size is large enough (because the standard error will be small). Practical (or clinical) significance: relates to the size of an effect and should be reported to provide context to the hypothesis test results. For an interesting (and short) read about practical and statistical significance have a look at this Significance Magazine article. 8.7 Summary This chapter has covered the underlying concepts of hypothesis testing; a test statistic is obtained and compared to a reference distribution. Where the test statistic lies on this reference distribution provides evidence to either reject, or not reject, the null hypothesis. In terms of the \\(p\\)-value: a small \\(p\\)-value indicates that the test statistic is very unlikely to be obtained when the null hypothesis is true - \\(H_0\\) is rejected in favour of \\(H_1\\). a large \\(p\\)-value indicates the test statistic is likely to be obtained when the null hypothesis is true - \\(H_0\\) cannot be rejected. The \\(t\\) tests rely on data being normally distributed; if this is not a valid assumption, non-parametric tests can be used. In chapter 9, we consider hypothesis tests for when there are more than two groups. For more information about hypothesis testing in general see. 8.7.1 Learning outcomes In this chapter you have seen how to define test hypotheses and determine whether one-tailed or two-tailed tests should be used, calculate a test statistic for a one, two and paired sample \\(t\\) tests, decide whether to reject, or otherwise, the null hypothesis based on the \\(p\\)-value and testing at a fixed significance level, use a non-parametric alternative to \\(t\\)-tests, and consider the practical and statistical significance of a test. 8.8 Answers Q8.1 The sample statistics were \\(n\\)=100, \\(\\hat \\mu = 99.06\\) and \\(s=9.58\\). Q8.1 a. We want to determine if the population mean could be 100 grams. The null and alternative hypotheses to be tested with a two-tailed test are: \\[H_0: \\mu = 100\\] \\[H_1: \\mu \\ne 100\\] Q8.1 b. The test statistic is \\[t_{stat} = \\frac{\\hat \\mu - m_0}{\\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}} = \\frac{99.06 - 100}{\\frac{9.58}{\\sqrt{100}}} = -0.9812\\] Q8.1 c. The value provided in the output (i.e. -1.984) was the critical value (\\(t{crit}\\)) in the lower tail, testing at a fixed significance level of 5%. In this case \\(t_{crit} &lt; t_{stat}\\) and so there is no evidence to reject the null hypothesis; the sample could have been generated from a population with mean 100 grams. d. The exact \\(p\\)-value associated with the test statistic for a two-tailed test will be provided by the command: pt(q=-0.9812, df=99) * 2 [1] 0.3288859 Q8.2 The claim is that Brand A batteries last longer than Brand B. Therefore, the hypotheses will be: \\[H_0: \\mu_A - \\mu_B = 0\\] \\[H_1: \\mu_A - \\mu_B &gt; 0\\] The test statistic is given by \\[t_{stat} = \\frac{(\\hat \\mu_A - \\hat \\mu_B) - 0}{se(\\mu_A - \\hat \\mu_B)}\\] First calculate the standard error of the difference: \\[se(\\hat{\\mu_A} - \\hat{\\mu_B})= \\sqrt{\\frac{{s_A}^2}{{n_A}} + \\frac{{s_B}^2}{{n_B}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{6.32^2}{90} + \\frac{3.31^2}{60}} = 0.7915\\] Thus, the test statistic is: \\[t_{stat} = \\frac{(49.5 - 46.1) - 0}{0.7915} = 4.2956\\] For ease of calculation, the degrees of freedom for the relevant \\(t\\) distribution are given by: \\[df = Min(n_A - 1, n_B - 1) = Min(89, 59) = 59\\] The critical value will be found from R and since this is a one-tailed test, we only want the area in the upper tail. qt(p=0.05, df=59, lower.tail=FALSE) [1] 1.671093 This value is less than the test statistic and so there is evidence to reject the null hypothesis, testing at a 5% significance level, and conclude that brand A lasts longer than brand B. The exact \\(p\\)-value is found using the pt function: pt(q=4.2956, df=59, lower.tail=FALSE) [1] 3.298826e-05 In confirmation, the \\(p\\)-value is small (i.e. &lt;0.001). Q8.3 Let the two groups, high protein and low protein diets, be defined by \\(H\\) and \\(L\\), respectively. Q8.3 a. The null and alternative hypotheses are \\[H_0: \\mu_H - \\mu_L = 0\\] \\[H_1: \\mu_H - \\mu_L \\ne 0\\] Q8.3 b. The test statistic was calculated from the data estimate (difference in means) minus the hypothesised value divided by the standard error of the difference. \\[\\textrm{test statistic} = \\frac{(\\hat \\mu_H - \\hat \\mu_L) - 0}{se(\\hat \\mu_H - \\hat \\mu_L)}\\] \\[ 1.9107 =\\frac{120 - 101}{9.944} \\] Q8.3 c. The \\(p\\)-value is 0.07821 which provides weak evidence to reject the null hypothesis. Q8.4 The two remaining assumptions are: Independence of the data within and between groups. Data are normally distributed.

R. A. Fisher, 1934. 9.1 Introduction Previously we have considered the comparison of two groups. In this chapter, we consider the comparison of more than two group means using a procedure called analysis of variance (generally called ANOVA). ANOVA indicates whether at least one group is different from at least one other group mean. To identify where those differences lie, we need to then consider each of the pairwise comparisons but taking into account that we are making several comparisons. In this chapter we will consider: the number of comparisons when there are more than two groups, determining if there is a difference in the group means and where any differences might lie, checking test assumptions and alternative methods if the assumptions are not valid. 9.2 Multiple comparisons We start with a motivating example; a sample of plants have been grown in three different growing mediums and the amounts of various chemical elements in a leaf from each plant have been obtained. It was felt that the chemical composition of the plants was specific to growing medium and, if so, this may help identify where the plants were grown. The growing mediums, or groups, were classified as B, N and P and here, we are interested in whether the mean titanium levels differ between the three groups (Figure 9.1). Figure 9.1: Distributions of titanium levels in three groups. In Figure 9.1 we see that there is substantial overlap in the values between the three groups and so we will require formal methods to determine if the underlying groups means are the same, or if there is a real difference (beyond sampling variability). We could conduct a series of two sample \\(t\\) tests and compare B with N, B with P and N and P. However, the more tests we undertake, i.e. when making a series of comparisons, the higher the chance of drawing a false conclusion. 9.2.1 Type I and Type II error When using a fixed significance level to draw a conclusion, the significance level, \\(\\alpha\\) is the associated error rate - the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is, in fact, true. For example, a significance level of 5% (\\(\\alpha=0.05\\)) means that there is a 5% chance of rejecting the null hypothesis when it should not be rejected (e.g. there is no difference between means). This is known as a Type I error. The converse error also exists, called a Type II error. Type I error - rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true (false positive) Type II error - not rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false (false negative) Table 9.1 should help with understanding. Table 9.1: Possibilities for \\(H_0\\) and the decision based on test results. Outcome of test \\(H_0\\) True \\(H_0\\) False Reject \\(H_0\\) Type I Error Correct decision Fail to reject \\(H_0\\) Correct decision Type II Error In comparing each pair of groups, there is a Type I error associated with each test and the Type I error compounds every time we do an additional test. The error rate over all possible pairwise comparisons is then no longer 5% and increases the chance of drawing false conclusions. We come back to this later in the chapter but essentially what we need is one test that compares all group means simultaneously; we do this using one-way Analysis of Variance. 9.3 ANalysis Of VAriance (ANOVA) We want to test for differences in means between three or more groups. The null hypothesis will be that the group means are the same and the alternative hypothesis will be that, at least, one mean is different from at least one other mean. Example The null hypotheses to compare the mean titanium levels in three groups, B, N and P is: \\[ H_0: \\mu_{\\textrm{B}} = \\mu_{\\textrm{N}} = \\mu_{\\textrm{P}} \\] The alternative hypothesis is usually specified as \\[H_1: \\textrm{at least one mean is different from one of the other means}\\] because specifying all the options is rather long-winded, i.e. \\(\\mu_{\\textrm{B}} = \\mu_{\\textrm{N}} \\ne \\mu_{\\textrm{P}}\\) or \\(\\mu_{\\textrm{B}} \\ne \\mu_{\\textrm{N}} = \\mu_{\\textrm{P}}\\) or \\(\\mu_{\\textrm{B}} \\ne \\mu_{\\textrm{P}} = \\mu_{\\textrm{N}}\\) or \\(\\mu_{\\textrm{B}} \\ne \\mu_{\\textrm{N}} \\ne \\mu_{\\textrm{P}}\\). If \\(H_0\\) is true, we would expect the group means to be similar and any observed differences between the sample means is due to sampling variation only. However, as we have seen comparing two groups, detecting differences between group means depends on the variability associated with each group. If there are no differences between means (i.e. the null hypothesis is true) then any differences between the group means are likely to be small compared with the within group variability (Figure 9.2). Figure 9.2: Illustration of between and within group variability; the mean for groups 1 and 2 is 30 and the mean for group 3 is 20. The standard deviation is 2.5 in the left plot and 8 in the right. The ANOVA procedure explicitly compares the between and within group variability to test \\(H_0\\). This is done using an \\(F\\) test statistic. 9.3.1 \\(F\\) test statistic for ANOVA The \\(F\\) test statistic for ANOVA is the ratio of the variability between groups (\\(s_G^2\\)) and the variability within groups (\\(s_W^2\\)): \\[f_0=\\frac{s^2_G}{s^2_W}\\] The numerator, \\(s^2_G\\), represents the difference between each group mean and the overall mean (combined across groups). It will be large if there are large differences between the group means: \\[s^2_G=\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{k} n_i (\\bar{x}_{i}-\\bar{x}_{.})^2}{k-1}= \\frac{SS_G}{k-1}\\] where \\(k\\) is the number of groups, \\(n_i\\) is the sample size for group \\(i\\) and \\(i=1, ..., k\\), \\(\\bar{x}_{i}\\) is the sample mean for group \\(i\\), and \\(\\bar{x}_{.}\\) is the sample mean across all groups combined. The denominator, \\(s^2_W\\), represents the variability within groups (via \\(s^2_i\\)) weighted by sample size within groups. It will be large if the data vary a great deal within groups (Figure 9.2, right hand plot): \\[s^2_W = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{k}(n_i-1)s_i^2}{n_{tot} - k} = \\frac{SS_W}{n_{tot} - k}\\] where \\(s_i^2\\) is the sample variance for group \\(i\\), and \\(n_{tot}\\) is the total number of observations across all groups. If \\(H_0\\) is true, \\(f_0\\) should be small - differences between means are small compared with the spread within groups. If \\(H_0\\) is false, \\(f_0\\) should be large - differences between means will be large compared to the spread within groups. Evidence against \\(H_0\\) is provided by values of \\(f_0\\) which would be unusually large when \\(H_0\\) is true. How large is large? Deciding if a test statistic is typical under the null hypothesis, we compare the test statistic with a reference distribution; in this case, the \\(F_{(df_1,df_2)}\\) distribution, where \\(df_1=k-1\\) and \\(df_2=n_{tot}-k\\) is used. This distribution is also used to obtain an exact \\(p\\)-value for the test; we will use R for this in general (although there are tables where critical values can be looked up). Before looking at the \\(F\\) distribution, we examine how \\(f_0\\) is calculated. As with \\(p\\)-values, we will generally use R to calculate \\(f_0\\), however, it is useful to see how it is calculated and presented. 9.3.2 Calculating an ANOVA table A convenient way to compile all the values for an \\(F\\) test statistic is to compile an ANOVA table (Table 9.2). The variability observed in the data is partitioned into the pattern, or signal, which can be explained by the different groups and then what is left over, called errors or residuals. Residuals will crop up later when regression models are described. In fact with ANOVA, we are fitting a model, it is just that the explanatory variable is a nominal variable.

To decide whether this is large, we compare it to the \\(F_{(df_1,df_2)}\\) distribution. 9.3.3 \\(F\\) distribution The \\(F\\) distribution (named in honour of R. A. Fisher) is a continuous distribution. It is defined by two parameters, \\(F_{df_1,df_2}\\), where, \\(df_1 = k - 1\\) \\(df_2 = n_{tot} - k\\). The \\(F\\) distribution can take on a variety of shapes but cannot have negative values. Figure 9.3 shows some examples of shapes and you can also explore the shape changes yourself in Figure 9.4. Figure 9.3: The probability density function of \\(F_{df1,df2}\\) distribution for different values of the parameters \\(df1\\) and \\(df2\\). Figure 9.4: Visualising the \\(F\\) distribution. You can see a live version by clicking here In our example, \\(df_1=2\\) and \\(df_2=43\\) and this distribution is shown in Figure 9.5. We can see that the density (on the \\(y\\)-axis) at a value of about 6 on the \\(x\\)-axis is pretty much zero. Our test statistic is 28.31, hence the probability of obtaining a value as large and larger than this (i.e. \\(Pr(f \\ge 28.31)\\) where \\(f \\sim F_{2,43}\\)) is going to be very, very small; in fact the \\(p\\)-value is \\(&lt;0.0001\\). This indicates that it is very unlikely to obtain a value as large, or larger, than 28.31 when the group means are the same. We reject \\(H_0\\) and have strong evidence that at least one of the group means is different to one of the other means. Figure 9.5: Reference distribution, \\(F_{2,43}\\) distribution. 9.3.4 Doing this in R Fortunately, R removes the hard work and does all the calculations, however, to make sense of the output created by the aov function, and create a neat ANOVA table, the summary function is used. # Fit ANOVA plant.aov &lt;- aov(Ti ~ Group, data=plant) # Display ANOVA table summary(plant.aov) Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F) Group 2 118.60 59.30 28.31 1.43e-08 *** Residuals 43 90.06 2.09 --- Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 The asterisks give a visual indication of the significance level; in this case the three asterisks (***) indicate that the \\(p\\)-value is between 0 and 0.001. One thing to note is that the \\(p\\)-value is only associated with the upper tail. Hence, if we want to calculate the exact \\(p\\)-value, the upper tail has to be specified in the function to obtain the \\(p\\)-value, or indeed if we want to obtain a critical value. # Exact p-value pf(q=28.31, df1=2, df2=43, lower.tail=FALSE) [1] 1.429293e-08 # Critical value, testing at a significance level of 5% qf(p=0.05, df1=2, df2=43, lower.tail=FALSE) [1] 3.21448 The critical value, testing at a significance level of 5%, is 3.21 - our test statistic (\\(f_0\\)=28.31) is much larger than this, hence, leading us to the same conclusion. Q9.1 A consumer organisation was interested in comparing the price of petrol (pence per litre) in four different locations classified as city, motorway, rural and town. Prices at ten petrol stations, selected at random for the four locations, were recorded; a summary of the results are provided below.

What do you conclude regarding the mean prices between locations? qf(p=0.05, df1=3, df2=36, lower.tail=FALSE) [1] 2.866266 9.3.5 Assumptions In order for the \\(F\\) test results to be valid, we need the following assumptions to be met: Independence: the data are sampled independently, Normality: the data for each group appears to have come from a Normal distribution, Constant spread: the underlying standard deviations for each group appear to be equal. ANOVA is reasonably robust to departures from the constant spread and Normality assumptions, however, the independence assumption is critical for valid results. As a conservative rule of thumb, ANOVA should give reliable results if the largest standard deviation of the groups is no larger than twice the smallest standard deviation of the groups. Example We can check these assumptions for the ANOVA we have conducted on the plant data. Within each group, different plants were measured for titanium levels and without knowing further details of the data collection, we assume the values are independent. The other assumptions can be tested more formally. 9.3.5.1 Checking constant spread Table 9.4 indicates that the standard deviations are similar in each group based on the rule of thumb - the smallest is 1.318 and the largest is 1.622. Levenes test provides a formal test. The null hypothesis is that the population variances for each group are equal (called homogeneity of variances, or homoscedasticity); for example \\[H_0: \\sigma_B^2 = \\sigma_N^2 = \\sigma_P^2 \\] The test statistic is compared to an \\(F_{df_1,df_2}\\) distribution (i.e. the same reference distribution as for ANOVA) and we use R to illustrate this. The car (Fox and Weisberg 2019) library is required for Levenes test. library(car) leveneTest(Ti ~ Group, data=plant) Levene&#39;s Test for Homogeneity of Variance (center = median) Df F value Pr(&gt;F) group 2 0.1852 0.8316 43 The \\(p\\)-value is interpreted in the same way as for other hypothesis test - in this example, the \\(p\\)-value is large and so we cannot reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the variances are the same. 9.3.5.2 Checking normality To check whether the data are normally distributed we can examine the observations (as in Figure 9.1) or look at the residuals (differences between the observations and the values created when fitting the model). The residuals should lie on a straight line if they are normally distributed. (There will be more on residuals and residual plots in a later chapter.) # Plot a normal QQ plot qqnorm(plant.aov$residuals) # Add a line to the plot qqline(plant.aov$residuals) Figure 9.6: Quantile-quantile plot of residuals. Figure 9.6 indicates that the residuals lie roughly on a straight line. To formally check, we can undertake a Shapiro-Wilk test. The null hypothesis for this test is that the data come from a normally distributed population. shapiro.test(plant.aov$residuals) Shapiro-Wilk normality test data: plant.aov$residuals W = 0.98038, p-value = 0.6216 We see from the results that the \\(p\\)-value is large (0.62), thus, there is no evidence to reject the null hypothesis and we can conclude that the data are normally distributed. All the assumptions have been checked (as far as possible) and are valid for these plant data. Thus, we can move on with the analysis to determine where differences lie. 9.4 Identifying differences (and more on multiple comparisons) ANOVA identifies whether, or not, a difference exists between at least one pair of group means. If a difference exists, the next stage is to identify which pairs of groups are different and how large any differences might be. There will be three pairwise comparisons for three groups (B-N, B-P and N-P) but the number soon increases with more groups; the number is given by for \\(k\\) groups: \\[\\textrm{number of pairwise comparisons} = \\frac{k!}{(k-2)!2!}\\] We could build 95% confidence intervals for each pairwise comparison but each has a Type I error rate of 5%; these errors compound and so we can adjust the error rate so that the overall, or family wise, error rate is 5%. There are various methods of making this adjustment and here we look at two methods (Bonferroni and Sidak corrections) and Tukeys Honest Significance Differences for adjusted confidence intervals. Q9.2 If there are four groups to be compared (as in Q9.1), how many pairwise comparisons can be made? 9.4.1 Sidak correction Let the probability of a Type I error be \\(\\alpha_1\\). Hence, the probability of not making a Type I error is given by \\(1 - \\alpha_1\\) and so the probability of not making a Type I error for a series of \\(c\\) tests is \\((1 - \\alpha_1)^c\\), assuming that the tests are independent. Thus, the probability of making an error with the series of tests is \\(1 - (1 - \\alpha_1)^c\\). We would like this probability to equal \\(\\alpha\\) and rearranging this equation provides the Sidak correction. The Sidak correction for the new threshold \\(p\\)-value is calculated from: \\[\\alpha_{adj} = 1 - (1-\\alpha)^{\\frac{1}{c}}\\] where \\(\\alpha_{adj}\\) is the new threshold, \\(\\alpha\\) is the desired Type I error collectively (family error rate) and \\(c\\) is the number of comparisons. Example We have a control treatment and plan to compare it against 3 different treatments (so \\(c\\)=3) and require an overall Type I error of 5%: \\[\\alpha_{adj} = 1 - (1 - 0.05)^{\\frac{1}{3}}=0.01695\\] Rather than accept a result as significant if the probability is below 0.05, we accept it as significant if the \\(p\\)-value for each test is below 0.01695. 9.4.2 Bonferroni correction A simpler method (and therefore more well-known) is the Bonferroni correction; we calculate a new threshold \\(p\\)-value by dividing the desired Type I error rate (overall comparisons), by the number of comparisons: \\[\\alpha_{adj} = \\frac{\\alpha}{c}\\] Example We want to conduct a series of 5 two sample \\(t\\) tests with a desired overall error rate of 5%. The adjusted error rate is thus, \\(\\alpha_{adj} = 0.05/5 = 0.01\\). Therefore, a \\(p\\)-value &lt; 0.01 is required to conclude a significant result for each comparison. This method is considered to be conservative with respect to the family wise error rate, particularly if there are a large number of tests, or comparisons. This correction comes at the cost of increasing the Type II error. Q9.3 We would like to make a series of 6 comparisons with an overall, family wise error rate of 0.05. What will the adjusted error rate be for each test using both the Sidak and Bonferroni corrections? Which correction is more stringent? 9.4.3 Tukeys Honest Significant Difference (HSD) This method is similar to creating confidence intervals for differences between two means but modifies the standard error and multiplier resulting in wider confidence intervals. We then check to see if zero is contained within each CI to determine whether any pair of group means are significantly different with a family wise error rate of \\(\\alpha\\). Example We return to the data of titanium levels in plants grown in three different types of growing medium; previously we found that a difference does exist. We calculate Tukeys HSD for the pairwise comparisons to decide where any differences might lie (Table 9.5). Table 9.5: Differences and confidence intervals obtained using Tukeys HSD; the columns are described below. diff lwr upr p adj N-B 2.478 0.9545 4.001 0.0008236 P-B 3.75 2.54 4.96 6.734e-09 P-N 1.272 -0.1009 2.645 0.07432 the first column indicates the two groups being compared, diff is the point estimate of the difference in means between the two groups, lwr and upr are the lower and upper bounds, respectively, of the confidence interval for the difference taking into account the multiple comparisons, and \\(p\\) adj is the \\(p\\)-value evaluating the null hypothesis that the difference between the means of the populations is zero taking into account the number of multiple comparisons. In this case, one confidence interval contains zero (i.e. P-N); on average the mean titanium level in group P is between -0.1 units lower to 2.65 units higher than group N. An interval containing zero indicates that zero is a plausible value for the difference in means, thus the means for these two groups are not significantly different. The other intervals are significantly different - the interval does not contain zero. The mean titanium level in N is significantly higher than B - on average 0.95 to 4.00 units higher (95% confidence). Also, the level in P is significantly higher than in B - on average 2.54 to 4.96 units higher (95% confidence) As a comparison, Table 9.6 shows that standard 95% confidence intervals for each of the difference in means are slightly narrower than the confidence intervals obtained using Tukeys HSD (Table 9.5). Table 9.6: Standard 95% confidence intervals for each pairwise comparison.

Which locations are significantly different and which are not, testing at a significance level of 5%? b. Which two locations have the largest difference in means? 9.4.4 Multiple comparison dilema In making adjustments when performing multiple comparisons, we are trading one error for another; we control a Type I error at the cost of a Type II error. For example, when making multiple comparisons, the adjustments reduce the threshold probability level used to determine significance. This means that we wont make many Type I errors, but Type II errors could be large. This relates to a concept called power, which is covered in chapter 10. The choice of whether, or not, to make any adjustment is not straightforward and is generally context specific: sometimes people think adjustments should be made because they are really worried about Type I errors/false positives (e.g. concluding a treatment is effective when it isnt) sometimes making a Type II error/false negative could be concerning (e.g. when exploring new cancer drugs a promising drug might be missed). 9.5 Two-way ANOVA So far we have compared data where there has been only one division of the data into groups (e.g. growing medium) and so specifically we have considered one-way ANOVA. Frequently, we may need to account for an additional discrete variable (e.g. plant variety). This can be done using a two-way ANOVA. Like many statistical methods, ANOVA arose out of research in agricultural science and so the terminology used frequently references its development and here we use an agricultural example to illustrate its use (after (ClarkeCooke1998?). Suppose we are interested in the crop yield of 5 different varieties of a plant (e.g. potato). A large field is divided into 20 (4 by 5) small units (or plots) and each variety (denoted by A to E) is randomly assigned to 4 plots (Table @ref(tab:crd.example)). All plants are cultivated in the same way and each plot receives the same amount of fertilizer, for example. Thus, the only reason for systematic variation between plots would be different varieties. This design, where varieties were assigned to plots completely at random is known as a completely randomised design. We could analyse the data arising from this experiment with a one-way ANOVA. One realisation of a completely randomised design with 5 groups (A-E) assigned randomly assigned to four plots. C D A C B B B D E E C A B C D A D A E E It may be that there are differences within the field (e.g. fertility, drainage, depth of soil) such that even if the same variety was planted, the crop yield would differ in different parts of the field. Thus, when comparing the different varieties we also need to account for the differences in the field. To account for these differences, the field is divided into blocks (based on fertility, for example); each block contains enough plots to accommodate each variety once. In this example, a block would consist of 5 plots and each variety is randomly assigned to plots in each block (Table @ref(tab:rbd.example)). This is known as a randomised block design. The analysis is by a two-way ANOVA to account for differences between blocks and varieties. One realisation of a randomised block design with 5 groups (A-E) assigned randomly assigned within each row (block). E D C B A E C A B D D C A B E D A B C E 9.5.1 Calculating a two-way ANOVA table To calculate a two-way ANOVA table, we extend the one-way table (Table 9.7). Table 9.7: Components of a two-way ANOVA table. Source of variation df Sum Sq Mean Sq \\(F\\) value Between groups \\(k-1\\) \\(SS_G\\) \\(s_G^2\\) \\(f_0\\) Between blocks \\(b-1\\) \\(SS_B\\) \\(s_B^2\\) \\(f_B\\) Residuals \\((k-1)(b-1)\\) \\(SS_W\\) \\(s_W^2\\)    -  Total \\(n_{tot}-1\\) where: \\(s_B^2\\) is the mean sum of squares between blocks and \\[s_B^2 = \\frac{SS_B}{b-1}\\] We dont provide all formulae here for calculating the components of the ANOVA table and note some formula have changed compared to a one-way ANOVA (e.g. \\(SS_W\\)) but we illustrate the table with an example below. However, as before, the test statistic for testing the null hypothesis that all groups means are the same is given by: \\[f_0 = \\frac{s_G^2}{s_W^2}\\] We can also test the null hypothesis that the block means are the same: \\[f_B = \\frac{s_B^2}{s_W^2}\\] Example Lets return to the study looking at the mean titanium levels in plants grown in different growing mediums. Suppose that the plants were exposed to different light levels (classified as low, medium and high) and we want to take this into account in a two-way ANOVA. # Fit two-way ANOVA plant.aov &lt;- aov(Ti ~ Group + Light, data=plant) # Display ANOVA table summary(plant.aov) Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F) Group 2 118.60 59.30 27.369 2.82e-08 *** Light 2 1.22 0.61 0.283 0.755 Residuals 41 88.83 2.17 --- Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 As before, there are significant differences in the mean titanium levels between different growing mediums. The formulae to calculate test statistic for blocks follows the same pattern as for a one-way ANOVA: \\[s_B^2 = \\frac{SS_B}{b-1} = \\frac{1.22}{2} = 0.61\\] \\[f_B = \\frac{s_B^2}{s_W^2} = \\frac{0.61}{2.17} = 0.28\\] The reference distribution is \\(F_{df1=b-1, df2=(k-1)(b-1)}\\): # p=value for blocks pf(0.283, df1=2, df2=41, lower.tail=FALSE) [1] 0.7549797 The \\(p\\)-value is large and so the null hypothesis for blocks cannot be rejected in this example. 9.6 Alternative tests to ANOVA If the data do not fulfill the test assumptions of normality and constant spread (or equal standard deviations), alternative tests are available and two are briefly described below. Although some assumptions can be relaxed with these tests, other assumptions can not. If the data are not normally distributed, the Kruskal-Wallis test can be used as a non-parametric alternative to ANOVA; it can be thought of as a multi-level version of the Mann-Whitney test (chapter 8). However, this test does still assume that the groups have the same standard deviation. This test uses ranks and the null hypothesis is that the mean ranks of the groups is the same. The test statistic follows a \\(\\chi^2\\) (chi-square) distribution which is indexed by one parameter, the degrees of freedom; this distribution is discussed in chapter 12. If the groups do not have similar standard deviations (heteroscedastic), an adaptation to ANOVA, called Welchs ANOVA, can be used, although this still requires that the data are normally distributed. 9.6.1 Doing this in R The Kruskal-Wallis test is performed with the kruskal.test function: kruskal.test(Ti ~ Group, data=plant) Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test data: Ti by Group Kruskal-Wallis chi-squared = 26.286, df = 2, p-value = 1.959e-06 The \\(p\\)-value is interpreted in the same way; here it is very small, providing evidence to reject the null hypothesis. There is also a function which provides multiple comparisons after the Kruskal-Wallis test (Siegel and Castellan 1988); this requires the pgirmess library (Giraudoux 2021). It identifies differences between groups depending on the specified significance level (0.05 by default). library(pgirmess) kruskalmc(Ti ~ Group, data=plant) Multiple comparison test after Kruskal-Wallis p.value: 0.05 Comparisons obs.dif critical.dif difference B-N 15.085470 13.93401 TRUE B-P 23.682692 11.06576 TRUE N-P 8.597222 12.55995 FALSE Welchs ANOVA is performed using welch.test which is in the onewaytests library (Dag et al. 2021) (this is not part of the base libraries and so will need to be installed).

Technically we have described a one-way ANOVA because data are divided by only one factor, i.e. the different groups. Two-way ANOVA is used where two factors are be taken into account. As with any statistical test, there are underlying assumptions which need to be met for the results to be valid and an appropriate test needs to be selected based on the data. The significance level (\\(\\alpha\\)) is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true (Type I error) and we want this to be small. The level should be set prior to any test and is the level you are happy to reject the null hypothesis. A value of \\(\\alpha=0.05\\) is frequently used but to decrease the chance of making a Type I error, a value of \\(\\alpha=0.01\\) is sometimes used. Most of the R functions provide an exact \\(p\\)-value associated with the test statistic - this is the probability of obtaining the test statistic, and one more extreme, if the null hypothesis is true. It is found from the area under the reference distribution associated with the test statistic. To decide whether to reject the null hypothesis, the \\(p\\)-value is compared to the \\(\\alpha\\) level set prior to the test. A \\(p\\)-value less than \\(\\alpha\\) provides evidence to reject the null hypothesis and a \\(p\\)-value greater than \\(\\alpha\\) does not provide evidence to reject the null hypothesis. If statistically significant differences are detected, then we want to determine where the differences lie. Comparing multiple pairwise combinations of groups increases the risk of making a Type I error and so to ensure that the desired error rate applies over all comparisons an adjustment can be made. In this chapter we have concentrated on the Type I error for a test; the Type II error is considered in a later chapter. More information about the \\(F\\) test for ANOVA can be found here 9.7.1 Learning outcomes In this chapter we have: undertaken a one-way analysis of variance to determine differences between more than two groups, determined where differences between groups lie, checked the test assumptions, and if the assumptions for ANOVA are not fulfilled, seen that an alternative test can be used. 9.8 Answers Q9.1 a.

Misattributed to Abraham Lincoln. 10.1 Introduction Statistical power is a measure of our ability to detect differences/effects given they actually do exist. In more formal statistical terms, it is our ability to reject the null hypothesis when it really should be rejected. Typically the question of power is raised in the planning of a study, e.g. What should the sample size be in order to detect a given effect, if one is present? Alternatively, one could ask What effect size could be detected, given a certain sample size? It is obvious when thinking about hypothesis tests that the probability of a result depends on both the underlying effect size and the sample size. The idea of power is intimately connected to the Type II errors. Remember that a Type I error is the probability of incorrectly rejecting \\(H_0\\) i.e. a false positive Type II error is the probability of incorrectly failing to reject \\(H_0\\) i.e. a false negative. These are shown in Table 10.1 along with the correct decisions. We control Type I errors in hypothesis tests by setting the threshold \\(p\\)-value (i.e. Type I error = \\(\\alpha\\)) but so far we have not considered controlling Type II errors (\\(\\beta\\)) in tests. In fact, the Type II error rate can be more difficult to calculate. (#tab:type1and2) Type I and Type II errors Outcome of test H\\(_0\\) True H\\(_0\\) False Reject H\\(_0\\) Type I Error, \\(\\alpha\\) Correct decision Fail to reject H\\(_0\\) Correct decision Type II Error, \\(\\beta\\) Statistical power is given by (\\(1-\\beta\\)) - this is the probability we correctly reject \\(H_0\\). Q9.1 Given what you know of statistical power so far, what aspects of a statistical test do you think would increase power? Calculating power requires we know (or speculate) about what the alternative hypothesis, \\(H_1\\), is - something we are usually very vague about. Similar to other hypothesis tests, our probability calculations are conditional on some hypothesised state being true. 10.2 A motivating example - Environmental impact assessment Wind and tidal current turbines (Figure 10.1) are being built around the world to provide green energy. Typically, as part of the environmental impact associated with such construction, people consider the effects of the turbines on wildlife before being built, during development and when they are in operation. The impact may be an actual population change caused by the turbines or a redistribution of the population caused by the turbines. Figure 10.1: A tidal current turbine. Typically, the impacts are assessed by means of surveys of animals, for example, observers counting the animals present at various times and recording their locations and estimating the animal populations. However, the distribution and number of animals might be effected by a number of other variables, such as tide-state, time of day, season etc., as well as the turbines. If no impact was found, this might be due to the fact that not enough surveying was undertaken. So a typical question might be, If animal numbers decreased by half after turbine construction, what amount of survey effort would be required to detect that change? Alternatively, a range of scenarios might be considered, as in (Table ??), where different population effects are considered as well as two different sampling regimes (i.e. longer monitoring times). Figure 10.2: Power (expressed as percentages) to detect an effect under different scenarios. For example, we would expect to detect a 20% reduction in the population if a further 6 months data are collected with a power of nearly 0.9. Power calculations are often required in order to determine how much data to collect. This will depend on: How big an effect do you need/hope to detect? How much variability is in the system? What level of power is needed? Armed with this information, we can advise on sample size, \\(n\\), to meet these specifications. Knowing the variability is the crucial issue; estimates might be obtainable from previous studies, a new pilot study or as a last resort, a guess. An estimate of variance from a pilot study might be inaccurate if sample size was low. 10.3 Calculating power (Example modified from Larsen &amp; Marx (2006)) Imagine there is a new fuel additive that is expected to increase the fuel efficiency for vehicles. The underlying fuel efficiency with the standard fuel is assumed to be 25 mpg. It is thought an improvement of at least 3% in fuel efficiency would be substantial enough for the additive to be taken to market. A trial is planned with the intention of detecting whether fuel efficiency with the additive has increased from 25 to 26 mpg (i.e. an approximate 3% increase) or even more. We need to first identify our assumptions: Fuel efficiency in cars is normally distributed. The standard deviation of efficiency in cars is claimed to be \\(\\sigma\\) = 2.4. We assume this is known (rather than estimated). Assuming an effect size (improvement) to 26 mpg is desired, and a sample size of 30, what is the power and Type II error associated with this (one-sided) test scenario? The underlying hypothesis test here is a one sample \\(z\\) test (because \\(\\sigma\\) is known; if this were estimated, we would use a \\(t\\) test). The null and alternative hypotheses are: \\(H_0\\): \\(\\hat \\mu = 25\\) \\(H_1\\): \\(\\hat \\mu &gt; 25\\) The test is one-tailed because we are considering an improvement in efficiency. It would be two-tailed is we were considering a difference in efficiency between the two fuels. The test statistic is given by \\[ z_{stat} = \\frac{\\textrm{data-estimate} - \\textrm{hypothesised value}}{\\textrm{standard error(data-estimate)}} = \\frac{\\hat \\mu - \\textrm{hypothesised value}}{\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}}\\] We would reject \\(H_0\\) if \\(z_{stat}\\) is greater than the critical value, \\(z_{crit}\\), i.e. \\(z_{stat} &gt; z_{crit}\\): \\[ \\frac{\\hat \\mu - \\textrm{hypothesised value}}{\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}} &gt; z_{crit}\\] Thus, we can rearrange this expression to provide a value of \\(\\hat \\mu\\) that would be required to reject \\(H_0\\): \\[\\hat \\mu &gt; \\textrm{hypothesised value} + \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}z_{crit}\\] Assuming the Type I error is 5%, (\\(\\alpha\\) = 0.05), we know that the one-tailed critical value, \\(z_{crit}\\), is: qnorm(p=0.95) [1] 1.644854 The hypothesised value is 25, so that the critical value that would cause us to reject \\(H_0\\) can be calculated as follows: \\[25 + 1.644854 \\times \\frac{2.4}{\\sqrt{30}} = 25.72\\] Figure 10.3 shows the probability density function under the null hypothesis i.e. \\(N(\\mu=25, \\sigma=2.4)\\). The red shaded area indicates critical value that would lead us to rejecting the null hypothesis under \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\). Figure 10.3: Probability density function of the reference distribution showing the Type I error region (shaded red). Hence, if our sample had a mean greater than 25.72 mpg we would reject \\(H_0\\). In rejecting the Null hypothesis we are at risk of making a Type I error. The Type II error, needs to be considered as well (Figure 10.4), relative to the alternative hypothesis. If \\(H_1\\) were true with its greater mean, and had the same standard deviation, we would produce false negatives (Type II errors) by falling left of this decision boundary. Figure 10.4: Probability density function of reference distribution showing the Type I error region (shaded red) and the Type II error region (shaded purple). To calculate the purple false negative area if \\(\\mu = 26\\) in R: pnorm(q=25.72, mean=26, sd=2.4/sqrt(30), lower.tail=TRUE) [1] 0.2614083 Thus, a Type II error occurs about 26.1% of the time. Power is \\(1-\\beta = 1 - 0.2614 = 0.7386\\) i.e. 73.9% Therefore, we would fail to find evidence of a 1 mpg improvement almost a quarter the time. 10.3.1 Increasing the power In the above case the power might be thought of as not very high. The obvious adaptions to make an improvements to this poor power are: Increasing precision through larger samples. Increasing precision through controlling variability (e.g. testing on a standardised track or the like). Accept a higher Type I error. Have a fuel additive that is expected to have improvements much greater than 1 mpg. 10.3.1.1 Increasing the sample size What happens if \\(n\\) is doubled? The decision boundary is now at: decisionBound &lt;- 25+1.644854*2.4/sqrt(60) decisionBound [1] 25.50964 Therefore the false negative rate is pnorm(q=decisionBound, mean=26, sd=2.4/sqrt(60)) [1] 0.05675267 This means our Type II error is about 5.7% - a power of 94.3%. A power of 80% is frequently used as the goal when planning studies and experiments. 10.3.1.2 Increasing the effect size Bigger changes in effect size would give higher power too, for example, we could consider 26.5 mpg instead of 26 mpg: pnorm(q=decisionBound, mean=26.5, sd=2.4/sqrt(60)) [1] 0.0006958301 Power is now therefore 1 - 0.0007 = 99.9%; increasing the signal-to-noise ratio improves power. 10.3.1.3 Accepting a higher Type I error rate Accepting an increased Type I error (e.g. \\(\\alpha=10\\%\\)) similarly improves power - it lowers the decision boundary in this problem, but this might be undesirable. qnorm(p=0.9) [1] 1.281552 decisionBound &lt;- 25+qnorm(0.9)*2.4/sqrt(30) decisionBound [1] 25.56155 pnorm(q=decisionBound, mean=26, sd=2.4/sqrt(30)) [1] 0.1585039 Therefore the new power is 1 - 15.9 = 84.1% Given a Type II error of 26.1% versus 15.9% before (power moves from 73.9% originally to 84.1%). Essentially, we are trading the probability of making one type of error for another. 10.3.2 Power by simulation The above is a theoretical approach to the calculation of power; frequently these days, power is estimated by simulation. This is often a more intuitive approach. Using the above case, we assume the true mean was normally distributed with mean 26 mpg and standard deviation 2.4. If 1000 samples (of size 30) are randomly generated from this distribution and the sample mean calculated each time, the proportion of the means greater than the critical value from the Null distribution (i.e. assuming \\(\\mu\\) =25) would give the power. The code below implements this process. # Initialise vector to store results value &lt;- NA set.seed (101) # Critical value zcrit &lt;- qnorm (p=0.95, mean=25, sd=2.4/sqrt(30)) # Begin loop for (i in 1:1000) { # Generate random sample samplepower &lt;- rnorm (n=30, mean=26, sd=2.4) ###this is truth # Test mean of sample, if &gt; zcrit value=1, otherwise value=0 if (mean(samplepower) &gt; zcrit) {value[i]=1} else {(value[i]=0)} } # End loop # Calculate proportion power &lt;- sum(value)/1000 power [1] 0.757 The generated power is similar to 73.8%, the value obtained above using a theoretical approach. If the number of iterations is increased the generated power converges ever closer to 73.8%. Similarly, if the sample size is increased to 60 (i.e. n = 60 above) then an answer similar to the theoretical figure of approximately 94.3% is obtained. # Initialise vector to store results value &lt;- NA set.seed (101) # Critical value zcrit &lt;- qnorm (p=0.95, mean=25, sd=2.4/sqrt(60)) # Begin loop for (i in 1:1000) { # Generate random sample samplepower &lt;- rnorm (n=60, mean=26, sd=2.4) ###this is truth # Test mean of sample, if &gt; zcrit value=1, otherwise value=0 if (mean(samplepower) &gt; zcrit) {value[i]=1} else {(value[i]=0)} } # End loop # Calculate proportion power &lt;- sum(value)/1000 power [1] 0.95 An interactive example of simulation based power analysis with varying sample size is in Figure 10.5. There is also a live version here Figure 10.5: An example of simulation based power analysis. You can see a live version by clicking here 10.3.3 Multiple comparisons As discussed previously, when we make multiple comparisons and we adjust the family wise error rate (see the previous chapter) we are decreasing the risk of a Type I error but increasing the risk of a Type II error leading to a lower power. We make our Type I error boundaries more stringent (broader) i.e. lower threshold \\(p\\)-values. We are trading errors at some level, i.e., if the Type II errors increase, the power decreases. 10.4 Summary Power should be an essential component of planning a statistical investigation. As mentioned above, a common convention is that a study should have power of c. 80% to be viable. Small sample sizes, trying to distinguish very small effect sizes and sloppy measurement with high variance will decrease the power of a test and lead to a low probability of rejecting \\(H_0\\). If these activities are undertaken to deliberately fail to reject \\(H_0\\) then this would be scientific misconduct. There are myths propagated in some scientific disciplines about statistical power, namely that the power of a test can be assessed post-hoc to determine if the found negative results are justified. To be blunt, this is nonsense. Power is numerically related to probability for a given null hypothesis, therefore, any result which fails to reject the null hypothesis will have low power. It is meaningless to calculate power post-hoc as a way of ascertaining the appropriateness of a null result. 10.4.1 Learning Objectives At the end of this chapter you should: understand power and its appropriate uses calculate simple power statistics, and understand when power should not be used. 10.5 Answers Q9.1 Power is all about the signal to noise ratio, therefore, we can either: increase the signal i.e. assume a bigger effect size or decrease the noise i.e. increase the precision typically by increasing sample size.

Sir Francis Bacon (1696) 11.1 Introduction Data often come as counts or frequencies which can be transformed to proportions. For example, imagine a survey where at each of several locations, the presence or absence of one or more birds is noted. The proportion of locations where a bird was located can be obtained from \\[\\textrm{proportion of bird locations} = \\frac{\\textrm{number of locations where one or more birds are seen}}{\\textrm{total number of locations}}\\] We can use the observed proportion to estimate the probability of seeing one or more birds at a particular locality, \\(x\\), out of the number of trials, \\(n\\), to estimate the probability of success, \\(p\\): \\[\\hat p = \\frac{x}{n}\\] Hence, we estimate the true underlying probability \\(p\\) with the sample proportion \\(\\hat p\\). If different locations had been sampled, then the observed proportion of locations where a bird was detected would likely change. There is some uncertainty associated with the sample proportions. Therefore in this chapter we consider: confidence intervals for proportions confidence intervals for a difference in proportions and a hypothesis test for a proportion. Proportions and probabilities are similar in that they are both bounded by 0 and 1 and the terms are often used interchangeably, not least because the sample proportion is frequently used to estimate the underlying (but unknown) population probability of success. In some cases, looking at the difference between proportions is not possible or relevant and so a ratio is obtained - this is called an odds ratio and discussed at the end of this chapter. 11.2 Confidence intervals To illustrate the formulation of CI for a proportion, we can consider the bird survey mentioned above. Imagine the birds were surveyed at three different time periods (perhaps before (which we will call phase A), during (phase B) and after (phase C) the building of a windfarm. There are two obvious questions of interest: in what proportion of localities will a bird be seen and what is the difference in the proportion of birds seen between the phases? To estimate the proportion of localities with birds in this region assume that the number of locations where a bird was detected \\(x\\) is a random variable from a binomial distribution with known \\(n\\) (fixed number of trials, i.e. all sampling locations) and unknown \\(p\\) (probability of success). We will estimate the proportion of successful observations, \\(p\\), from the number of observations with sightings (successes) and the total number of observations (`trials). Recall, there are 4 conditions of the binomial distribution: two outcomes for each trial, the same probability of success for each trial, a fixed number of trials, independence of trials. Q11.1 How realistic are these conditions for the wind farm data? 11.2.1 Motivating example Trained observers recorded the presence or absence of birds at each spatial location: when birds were seen in some defined location a presence (success) was recorded and when birds were not seen it was recorded as an absence (failure). We estimate the probability of sighting an animal using: \\[\\hat{p}=\\frac{\\text{number of successes}}{\\text{number of trials}} \\] which in the wind farm data, as mentioned in the introduction, translates to: \\[\\hat p = \\frac{\\textrm{number of observations where one or more birds were seen}}{\\textrm{total number of observations}}\\] For each phase we have the number of successful observations and the number of observations in total (Table 11.1). Table 11.1: Number of presence (1) or absence (0) locations in phases A, B and C in the building of a windfarm. From this summary information we estimate the sighting probabilities in each phase as follows: A B C 0 10335 12495 5436 1 1143 1633 460 Total 11478 14128 5896 \\[\\hat p_{A} = \\frac{1143}{11478} = 0.0996 \\quad; \\quad \\hat p_{B} = \\frac{1633}{14128} = 0.1156 \\quad ; \\quad \\hat p_{C} = \\frac{460}{5896} = 0.0780\\] We can estimate similar probabilities for each year and month (Figure 11.1) of the survey. The before period was from 2000 to 2002 inclusive, the during period was 2003 and 2007 and the after period was 2011. Figure 11.1: Barplot showing the mean sightings probability for every year/month combination. N.B.Not all months are labelled From this information (Figure 11.1) we see that: the proportion of sighting a bird appears to be higher in phase B compared with the phases A and C, and the proportion of sighting a bird tends to be highest in January-March of each year. While some patterns are apparent, it is difficult to tell if the observed differences are genuine differences across phases and/or year-month combinations or if these differences are due to sampling error; would these differences have been seen even if the true underlying (but unknown) probability of sighting for all phases (and/or year-month combinations) was the same? To assess the uncertainty associated with a sample proportion, we build a confidence interval and the formulation of the interval depends on the number of trials, \\(n\\), and on the value of \\(p\\). 11.2.2 Confidence intervals: large sample sizes While the number of successes from the number of trials is assumed to be a binomial random variable, the sample proportions (estimates for \\(p\\); \\(\\hat{p}\\)) are normally distributed about the true (underlying) population proportion if the number of trials is large. Therefore, confidence intervals (CIs) for proportions are constructed in a similar way to CIs for large samples of normal data. For large samples, the sample proportion is approximately normally distributed: \\[\\hat{p} \\sim normal \\left(p, se({p})\\right)\\] However, since we never know \\(p\\), we use the sample proportion \\(\\hat p\\), thus, the standard deviation of the sample proportion (the standard error) can be found using: \\[se(\\hat{p})=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat p (1-\\hat p)}{n}}\\] Just as with means we can create 95% confidence interval on the proportions. To find a 95% confidence interval for \\(p\\) we use a familiar structure: \\[\\begin{align*} \\textrm{estimate}~~ &amp;\\pm z_{1-\\frac{\\alpha}{2}} \\times~~ \\textrm{standard error}\\\\ \\hat{p} &amp; \\pm 1.96 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p} (1-\\hat{p})}{n}} \\end{align*}\\] where \\(\\alpha=0.05\\) for a 95% CI, hence \\(z_{0.025}\\). 11.2.2.1 How large is large enough? To assume these estimates are approximately normally distributed about \\(p\\) we require large samples. As the number of trials increases, the distribution becomes more and more like the normal distribution until the sample size is so large that the distribution is exactly normally distributed - it has reached a limit, or asymptote, hence, these CI are sometimes called asymptotic confidence intervals. However, the required sample size changes with \\(\\hat{p}\\). The minimum sample sizes for different values of \\(\\hat p\\) are given in Table 11.2. Thus if p is very small 0.05 or large 0.95, a sample size of at least 960 would be required in order to assume that the proportion is normally distributed.: Table 11.2: Sample sizes for to assume large-sample properties for proportions Value for \\(\\hat{p}\\) 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 0.25 0.3 0.35 0.4 0.45 0.5 Minimum \\(n\\) 960 400 220 125 76 47 23 13 11 10 Value for \\(\\hat{p}\\) 0.95 0.9 0.85 0.8 0.75 0.7 0.65 0.6 0.55 0.5 Example We are going to build 95% CIs for the proportion of sighting birds in phases A, B and C. The total number of sampled locations (\\(n\\)) for each phase is greater than 1000 and so results based on these large-sample properties should be valid. The CI for Phase A is constructed as follows: we estimated \\(p_A\\) previously, \\(\\hat p_A = 0.0996\\) and the standard error is given by: \\[se(\\hat{p_A})=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p_A}(1-\\hat{p_A})}{n}}= \\sqrt{\\frac{0.0996(1-0.0996)}{11478}}= 0.0028\\] \\[\\begin{align*} 95\\%~ \\textrm{CI}=&amp;\\hat{p} \\pm z_{0.025} \\times se(\\hat{p})\\\\ =&amp;0.0996 \\pm 1.96 \\times 0.0028\\\\ =&amp; (0.0941,0.1051) \\end{align*}\\] Based on these results we can be 95% confident that the proportion of locations with a bird in Phase A is somewhere between 0.094 (9.4%) and 0.105 (10.5%). We find 95% CI for the proportions in phases B and C and thus can say, with 95% confidence we estimate the proportion of a location with a bird in this region in Phase B to be somewhere between 0.11, 0.121 with 95% confidence we estimate the proportion of a location with a bird in this region in Phase C to be somewhere between 0.071, 0.085. 11.2.2.2 Doing this in R To calculate these confidence intervals in R, an additional package is required Hmisc (Harrell 2021): # Load package library(Hmisc) # 95% CI using asymptotic normal approximation; x=number of successes; # n=number of trials binconf(x=1143, n=11478, alpha=0.05, method=&quot;asymptotic&quot;) PointEst Lower Upper 0.09958181 0.09410374 0.1050599 11.2.3 Confidence intervals: small sample sizes For small samples (less than those in the table above) when \\(p\\) is close to zero or one, assuming the proportions are normally distributed is not valid. To illustrate this we calculate the 95% CI for \\(\\hat p=0.1\\) and \\(n=10\\). \\[se(\\hat p) = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.1 (1-0.1)}{10}} = 0.0949\\] Hence, the CI is given by \\[0.1 \\pm 1.96*0.0949\\] \\[0.1 \\pm 0.1859 \\] \\[-0.086 \\quad ; \\quad 0.286 \\] The lower limit is less than 0 and a proportion cannot be negative. Therefore, a different formulation is required for small sample sizes. The literature suggests that Wilson intervals are preferred in these cases (Agresti and Coull 1998). This has a rather more complicated formula: \\[\\frac{1}{1+{\\frac{1}{n}}z^{2}}\\left[{\\hat {p}}+{\\frac{1}{2n}}z^{2}\\pm z{\\sqrt{{\\frac {1}{n}}{\\hat{p}}\\left(1-{\\hat{p}}\\right)+{\\frac {1}{4n^{2}}}z^{2}}}\\right]\\] (and so we will be using R to calculate these values.) This approach ensures that the confidence interval limits never extend below zero or above one. For example, Table 11.3 the asymptotic (i.e. using the normal distribution) and Wilson confidence intervals are calculated when we have one success and 10 trials (i.e. \\(p=0.1\\)): Table 11.3: Comparison of Wilson and asymptotic confidence intervals with \\(p\\)=0.1 and \\(n\\)=10. PointEst Lower Upper Wilson 0.1 0.005129 0.4042 Asymptotic 0.1 -0.08594 0.2859 The lower limit for the confidence interval based on the normal distribution is negative - an implausible value for a proportion. According to our table of what is large, when \\(\\hat{p} = 0.1\\), we should have a sample size of more than 400 to use the method based on the normal distribution. If we increase the number of trials to 1000, (and the number of success to 100 so that \\(\\hat{p}=0.1\\)), then the asymptotic normal distribution-based interval no longer gives impossible values (Table 11.4). Table 11.4: Comparison of Wilson and asymptotic confidence intervals with \\(p\\)=0.1 and \\(n\\)=1000.

While there appears to be some differences across phases based on the results obtained so far, in order to statistically answer questions about changes in proportions over time, we need to formally test for differences between the groups (e.g. between phases or between different years or months). Rather than use confidence intervals, which give a range of likely values for each parameter, we test for no difference between the two parameter values and evaluate the strength of evidence against this null hypothesis. We formally compare two proportions with a hypothesis test, which uses the normal distribution as the reference distribution (known as a \\(z\\) test). So for example, we examine if there have been changes between phases in the windfarm data by comparing the differences we have observed between phases with the sorts of differences we would expect to see even if no genuine changes have occurred. 11.3.1 Testing for no difference between groups In order to test the research hypothesis that sighting proportions were different in phase A (\\(p_{A}\\)) and phase C (\\(p_{C}\\)) we take the following steps: We test this research hypothesis using the (skeptical) null hypothesis of no difference (\\(H_0\\)) and a `two-sided alternative hypothesis (\\(H_1\\)) of either a positive or negative difference: \\[H_0: p_{A}-p_{C}=0\\] \\[H_1: p_{A}-p_{C} \\neq 0\\] We evaluate the null hypothesis by considering what we would expect to see if the null hypothesis is true. For example, if there has been no difference in sighting probabilities between phases then we would expect to see small differences in the sighting rates across phases. small differences like these (based on sampling variability alone) provide us with the background for comparison with the differences we did observe across phases. We compare our data-estimate (i.e. the difference between \\(p_{A}\\) and \\(p_{C}\\)) with the hypothesised value (for no difference, or zero, in this case): \\[\\textrm{data-estimate} - \\textrm{hypothesised value}\\] Our data-estimate for the difference between the proportions is: the hypothesised value is 0, therefore our estimate is 0.0216 units. While the point estimate (of 0.0216) is useful, we know that if we had taken data from slightly different locations or at slightly different times we would have obtained a different set of data and so we need to consider the uncertainty in our estimate. The uncertainty in the estimate of the difference between the proportions can be quantified by the standard error of the difference: \\[\\begin{align*} se(\\hat{p}_A-\\hat{p}_C)=&amp;\\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}_A(1-\\hat{p}_A)}{n_A}+\\frac{\\hat{p}_C(1-\\hat{p}_C)}{n_C}}\\\\ \\end{align*}\\] \\[\\begin{align*} =&amp; \\sqrt{\\frac{0.0996(1-0.0996)}{11478}+\\frac{0.078(1-0.078)}{5896}}\\\\ = &amp; 0.004\\\\ \\end{align*}\\] This method of calculating the uncertainty in our estimate (the standard error formula) requires these sample proportions are independent. Do you think this is realistic in this case? 11.3.1.1 How does our estimate compare with the differences we might expect? Once we have quantified the uncertainty about our estimate we can represent the difference seen between sample proportions as a ratio of the standard error. \\[\\text{test statistic} = \\frac{\\text{difference - hypothesised value}}{\\text{standard error}}\\] This puts our estimate for the difference into perspective: small differences can look large if the standard error is small (and our estimate has high precision/low uncertainty) and large differences can look small (if our estimate has low precision/high uncertainty). In our example, even an apparently small difference is actually large when we consider the high precision/low uncertainty about the estimate: \\[\\begin{align*} \\textrm{test statistic} =&amp;\\frac{\\textrm{difference-hypothesised value}}{\\textrm{standard error}}\\\\ =&amp; \\frac{0.022}{0.004} = 4.82\\\\ \\end{align*}\\] This estimate is in excess of 4 standard errors above zero. This can be seen in Figure 11.3; where the test statistic is compared to the reference distribution i.e. a distribution that we might expect to see (because of sampling variability) even if there is no underlying difference in the values of the true proportions. Figure 11.3: Reference distribution for the \\(z\\) test: the differences between proportions that would be expected if \\(p_1=p_2\\). The dotted line indicates the test statistic. From here we can evaluate the chance of getting a value at least as extreme as 4.82 when \\(H_0\\) is true and there was no difference in proportions across phases. We do this using the normal distribution as a reference distribution because it turns out that when there are no differences across phases, the test statistic has a normal distribution with \\(\\mu=0\\) and \\(\\sigma=1\\). This distribution is known as the standard normal distribution or \\(z\\) distribution (Chapter 8). We use this reference distribution as a comparison with our observed test statistic. In this case, we find the chance of seeing a difference like this (or one more extreme) is very small: the probability is \\(10^{-6}\\). What can we conclude? We have strong evidence for a difference between the proportions of locations where birds were detected in phase A and phase C. We can reject the null hypothesis of no difference between proportions in phase A and phase C at the 1% level. Specifically, the probability of sighting a bird in Phase C appears to be significantly lower than in Phase A. 11.4 CI for the difference between population proportions, (\\(p_1-p_2\\)) In the wind farm example we are interested in asking if there are differences across phases. We can calculate the confidence interval for the difference in two proportions in the standard way: \\[\\textrm{difference between sample proportions} \\pm z\\textrm{-multiplier} \\times \\textrm{standard error of the difference}\\] \\[(\\hat p_1-\\hat p_2) \\pm z_{1-\\frac{\\alpha}{2}} \\times se(\\hat p_1-\\hat p_2)\\] However, the choice of formula for the standard error of the difference between two proportions can be important. For instance, it might be unrealistic to assume independence between samples and so the standard error formula used previously (situation A - see later) might be inappropriate. For this reason (and in lots of other situations) we may need to use a different formula to calculate the standard error, which acknowledges that both sample proportions are estimated from a common sample. In our example, it is possible that the proportions of locations where birds were detected in each phase are not independent because the two phases are likely to share animals. Similarly, the locations within each phase may not be independent, in that if there are birds in one location, birds may be more likely to be in nearby locations. 11.4.1 Choosing the appropriate standard error when comparing proportions When comparing proportions difference sorts of sampling situations can arise. This means that different standard errors should be used. The sampling situations we consider here are: Situation A - the proportions originate from independent samples. Situation B - the same sample gives rise to two (or more) proportions where the same individual can only choose one of the options (or can only contribute to ONE of the proportions being considered). Situation C - the same sample but an individual can choose more than one category (or can contribute to BOTH of the proportions being considered). 11.4.1.1 Situation A: Proportions from independent samples Example A random sample of 1000 people born in New Zealand is compared to a random sample of 1000 people born in Scotland, e.g. a respondent cant belong to both populations. \\[se(p_1-p_2) = \\sqrt{\\frac{p_1(1-p_1)}{n_1}+\\frac{p_2(1-p_2)}{n_2}}\\] 11.4.1.2 Situation B: One sample of size \\(n\\), several response categories Example A random sample of Scots are asked who they are going to vote for in the next election, e.g. one group of respondents slot into only ONE category and the proportions add to 1. \\[se(p_1-p_2) =\\sqrt{\\frac{p_1+ p_2-(p_1-p_2)^2}{n}}\\] 11.4.1.3 Situation C: One sample of size \\(n\\), many Yes/No items Example A random sample of Scots are asked: 1. Do you watch rugby? 2. Do you like beer? 3. Do you like licorice? e.g. one group of respondents can slot into MORE THAN ONE category. \\[se(p_1-p_2) = \\sqrt{\\frac{Min(p_1 + p_2, q_1 + q_2)-(p_1-p_2)^2}{n}}\\] where \\(q_1 = 1-p_1\\) and \\(q_2 = 1-p_2\\) and \\(Min(a, b)\\) denotes selecting the minimum from \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). The following graphics from Wild &amp; Seber(1999) may help visualise these situations. 11.4.1.4 Choosing different standard errors As an illustration of which standard error to choose, we consider the data from an international study carried out in 1998. The study was designed to measure peoples reactions to their health care system. A summary of the results are shown in Table 11.6: Table 11.6: Results from a 1998 study which surveyed 1000 people each from 5 countries about their health care system. Table entry is the percentage (%) agreeing to the statement. Statement Australia Canada N.Z. U.K. U.S. Difficulties getting needed care 15 20 18 15 28 Recent changes will harm quality 28 46 38 12 18 System should be rebuilt 30 23 32 14 33 No bills not covered by insurance 7 27 12 44 8 Sample size 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 Health care expenditure (USD per person) 1805 2095 1352 1347 4090 1. We want to compare the 30% of Australians agreeing to the System should be rebuilt with the 23% of Canadians agreeing to the same statement; which sampling situation is appropriate, A, B or C? Situation A is appropriate; we have two independent samples of people from different countries. Using the percentages, the proportions of interest are \\(\\hat p_1 = 0.3 = \\frac{300}{1000}\\); \\(\\hat p_2 = 0.23 = \\frac{230}{1000}\\) (with sample sizes of 1000) The standard error for the difference between these proportions is obtained using the formula \\[se(p_1-p_2) = \\sqrt{\\frac{p_1(1-p_1)}{n_1}+\\frac{p_2(1-p_2)}{n_2}}\\] \\[se(\\hat p_1-\\hat p_2) = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.30(1-0.30)}{1000}+\\frac{0.23(1-0.23)}{1000}}=0.0197\\] 2. The respondents could choose: agree disagree or dont know to the statements in the table above. If we compared the proportion of Canadians who agreed Recent changes will harm quality with those Canadians who disagreed with that statement (the percentage disagreeing was 15%), which sampling situation applies A, B or C? Situation B is appropriate. We have one sample of Canadians who either agree or disagree with this statement. \\(\\hat p_1 = \\frac{460}{1000} = 0.46\\); \\(\\hat p_2 = 0.15\\) The standard error for the difference between these proportions is obtained using the formula \\[se(p_1-p_2) =\\sqrt{\\frac{p_1+ p_2-(p_1-p_2)^2}{n}}\\] \\[se(\\hat p_1-\\hat p_2) =\\sqrt{\\frac{0.46+ 0.15-(0.46-0.15)^2}{1000}}=0.022\\] 3. If we wanted to compare the proportion of people in the U.K. agreeing to Difficulties getting needed care and agreeing to System should be rebuilt what sampling situation would apply, A, B or C? Situation C is appropriate. The same set of people are being asked (we have one sample) and they can agree with both these statements. \\(\\hat p_1 = \\frac{15}{100} = 0.15\\); \\(\\hat p_2 = \\frac{14}{100} = 0.14\\) The standard error for the difference between these proportions is obtained using the formula \\[se(p_1-p_2) = \\sqrt{\\frac{Min(p_1 + p_2, q_1 + q_2)-(p_1-p_2)^2}{n}}\\] \\(\\hat q_1 = 1 - \\hat p_1 = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85\\); \\(\\hat q_2 = 1 - \\hat p_2 = 0.86\\) \\[se(p_1-p_2) = \\sqrt{\\frac{Min(0.15 + 0.14, 0.85 + 0.86)-(0.15-0.14)^2}{1000}}\\] \\[se(p_1-p_2) = \\sqrt{\\frac{Min(0.29, 1.71)-(0.15-0.14)^2}{1000}}\\] \\[= \\sqrt{\\frac{0.29 - (0.15-0.14)^2}{1000}} = 0.017 \\] An example of the differences between the confidence intervals calculated using the different standard error formulae for situations (A, B or C) can be seen below. Q11.2 A survey was undertaken to ascertain the favourite film genre of undergraduates from the University of St Andrews (and only one genre could be chosen). The results were as follows: romantic comedies 13%, musicals 8%, science-fiction/fantasy 22%, romance 27%, westerns 5%, war 8%, horror 9%, other 8%. What sampling situation (i.e. A-C) best reflects this situation? Q11.3 If, from the same survey, the proportion of first year students who like romantic comedies is compared to the proportion of second year students who like romantic comedies, what sampling situation is this? Q11.4 If, instead of being asked to choose one favourite genre, the students can choose a number of genre they enjoy from a list, which may lead to, for example, 53% of students who said they liked romantic comedies etc. What sampling situation would this be? 11.5 Odds ratios In this section we calculate an odds ratio (OR) to quantify the extent of the association between two groups. An odds ratio is a relative measure of effect, which allows, for example, the comparison of an intervention group of a study relative to a control, or placebo, group. Therefore they are most often used in medicine to identify potential causes of disease or ascertain the effect of a treatment. We need first to define what are meant by statistical odds. Note: Statistical odds are not quite the same as betting odds. Betting odds are the probability of an event taking place which allow the prospective winnings to be calculated if the event happens. Statistical odds express relative probabilities. 11.5.1 Calculating the odds of success The odds of success are defined to be: \\[odds=\\frac{p(\\textrm{success})}{p(\\textrm{failure})} = \\frac{p}{1-p}\\] Hence, if \\(p=0.8\\), the odds of success are \\[odds=\\frac{p}{1-p}=\\frac{0.8}{1-0.8}=\\frac{0.8}{0.2}=4\\] A few points to note about odds: Odds are never negative. When the odds are greater than 1, then success is more likely than failure. When the odds of success=4 (for example), success is four times as likely as a failure; we expect 4 successes for every one failure. When the odds of success is \\(\\frac{1}{4}=0.25\\), failure is four times as likely as a success; we expect to see one success for every 4 failures. We can rearrange the formula above to obtain the probability of success from the odds: \\[p=\\frac{\\textrm{odds}}{\\textrm{odds+1}}\\] and so if the odds is 4, then \\[p=\\frac{4}{(4+1)}=\\frac{4}{5}=0.8\\]. 11.5.2 Calculating the odds of success for 2 x 2 tables In the wind farm example we are interested in comparing the odds of detecting at least one bird at a location in phase A compared with phase C. To calculate the odds of success in each of phase A and phase C we view the data as a 2 x 2 table, and calculate the odds of success for each row of this table. 0 1 Sum A 10335 1143 11478 C 5436 460 5896 Sum 15771 1603 17374 For the phase A (first row) we start by finding the sighting probability: \\[\\hat p_A=\\frac{1143}{1.1478\\times 10^{4}}=0.1\\] and from there we can find the odds of success: \\[\\textrm{odds}_A =\\frac{\\hat p_A}{(1-\\hat p_A)}=\\frac{0.1}{(1 - 0.1)}= 0.111\\] The odds for phase A are less than 1 which means that the probability of detecting a bird is much lower than the probability of not detecting a bird: failure (absence) is more likely than success (presence). We perform the same calculations for phase C. The probability of a bird is: \\[\\hat p_C=\\frac{460}{5896}=0.078\\] The odds of success is: \\[\\textrm{odds}_C = \\frac{\\hat p_C}{(1-\\hat p_C)}= 0.084621\\] The odds for phase C are also less than 1 which means that the probability of bird presence is much lower than the probability of bird absence. failure (absence) is more likely than success (failure). 11.5.3 Calculating the odds ratio The relevant odds known, the odds ratio can then be calculated: the numerator is the odds in the intervention arm/group 1 the denominator is the odds in the control arm/group 2 If the outcome is the same in both groups, the ratio will be 1: this implies there is no difference between the two arms (groups) of the study. However: if the OR is \\(&gt; 1\\) the intervention is better than the control. if the OR is \\(&lt; 1\\) the control is better than the intervention. For example, in the wind farm data, the two groups could be the presence (or absence) of animals seen A and C the wind farm development. So in the medical study of TEON, we might be interested in the presence, or absence, of blindness in people who are either Vitamin D deficient or have acceptable Vitamin D levels. Whatever the situation, we must calculate the odds of success for each of the two groups. We can find the ratio of these two values (a so-called odds ratio). We do this following the procedure stated earlier, the intervention is the numerator: \\[\\theta=\\frac{\\text{odds}_C}{\\text{odds}_A}=\\frac{\\hat{p}_C/(1-\\hat{p}_C)}{\\hat{p}_A/(1-\\hat{p}_A)}=\\frac{(460 / 5896) / (1-(460/ 5896))}{(1143 / 1.1478\\times 10^{4}) / (1-(1143 / 1.1478\\times 10^{4})}= 0.085/ 0.111= 0.765\\] Remember: If the OR is \\(&gt; 1\\) the intervention is better than the control. If the OR is \\(&lt; 1\\) the control is better than the intervention. In our example, the OR is \\(&lt;1\\) so the odds of seeing something in phase C (intervention group) is lower than the odds of seeing something in phase A (control group) as this ratio is less than 1. If the reverse was true, the odds ratio (\\(\\theta\\)) would be greater than 1 but can never be zero or negative. 11.5.4 Confidence intervals for odds ratios While the odds ratio calculated above is based on our sample estimates for the two proportions, and thus constitutes our `best guess for the odds ratio (\\(\\hat{\\theta}\\)), this value will change from survey to survey and so it is often useful to construct a 95% confidence interval for the odds ratio. Previously we have used the normal and \\(t\\)-distributions to construct confidence intervals, however, these are poor choices to use for confidence intervals based around the odds ratio because, unless the sample size is large, the sampling distribution for the odds ratio (\\(\\theta\\)) is highly skewed. For example, even if the true, and unknown, odds ratio is 1 the estimate cannot be much smaller (since it can never be zero or negative) but it can often be much higher just due to chance. This means the estimates are not guaranteed to be symmetrically distributed about the true odds ratio. For this reason, the log of the odds ratio is used as the centre of the associated confidence intervals since these estimates tend to be more symmetrical. Specifically, the log of the odds ratio estimates tend to be approximately normal with a mean of \\(\\log(\\theta)\\) and a standard error of: \\[se_{OR}=\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n_{11}}+\\frac{1}{n_{12}}+\\frac{1}{n_{21}}+\\frac{1}{n_{22}}}\\] where \\(n_{11}...n_{22}\\) are based on the number of observations in each group/outcome category. We can construct the 95% confidence interval for \\(\\log\\theta\\) using the estimate for \\(\\log\\hat{\\theta}\\). We can then get values back on the raw odds ratio scale by undoing this log function using the exponential function. For example, if we apply the log function to the value of 2 we get: log(2)=0.693 and we can undo this function by applying the exponential function: exp(0.693)=2. A large-sample, confidence interval for log of the odds ratio can be found using: \\[\\log(\\hat{\\theta}) \\pm z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\times se_{OR}\\] we can then exponentiate the upper and lower limits of this interval to obtain a confidence interval for the odds ratio. Example Back to our wind farm example, entries from the centre of the following table provide the numbers of observations, \\(n_{11}\\) etc.: 0 1 Sum A 10335 1143 11478 C 5436 460 5896 Sum 15771 1603 17374 So in this case, comparing phases A and C means these values are: the value for row 1 of interest in the table and in column 1: \\(n_{11}=10335\\) the value for row 1 of interest in the table and in column 2: \\(n_{12}=1143\\) the value for row 2 of interest in the table and in column 1: \\(n_{21}=5436\\) the value for row 2 of interest in the table and in column 2: \\(n_{21}=460\\) Therefore, the standard error of the odds ratio is: \\[se_{OR}=\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{1.0335\\times 10^{4}}+\\frac{1}{1143}+\\frac{1}{5436}+\\frac{1}{460}}=0.058\\] As is typical, the standard error decreases as the cell counts increase. For instance, if all cell entries were 10,000 the new \\(se_{OR}\\) would be just 0.02. In our example, the estimated odds ratio is: 0.765 and we are interested in whether this could be a 1:1 ratio and therefore even odds. A 95% confidence interval for this ratio is: \\[\\log(0.765) \\pm 1.960 \\times 0.058\\] which returns a lower limit of -0.381 and an upper limit of -0.155. These upper and lower limits are exponentiated: \\[\\big(\\text{exp}(-0.381), \\text{exp}(-0.155)\\big)\\] to give This result tells us that an odds ratio value of 1 is not a plausible value for the odds and so the odds in phase A appear to be genuinely higher than in phase C. Additionally, with 95% confidence we estimate the odds of presence of a bird in phase A compared with phase C appears to be somewhere between 0.683 and 0.857. 11.5.4.1 Doing this in R The package epitools - epidemiology tools (Aragon 2020) is used for calculating odds ratios. # Create object containing the number of successes (presence) and failures (absence) counts &lt;- c(1143, 10335, 460, 5436) # Convert to a matrix matcounts &lt;- matrix(counts, nrow=2, byrow=TRUE) # Add row and column names dimnames(matcounts) &lt;- list(&quot;Phase&quot;=c(&quot;A&quot;,&quot;C&quot;), &quot;AnimalsSeen&quot;=c(&quot;Presence&quot;,&quot;Absence&quot;)) matcounts AnimalsSeen Phase Presence Absence A 1143 10335 C 460 5436 # Load package require(epitools) # Odds ratio and CI OR &lt;- oddsratio(matcounts, method=&#39;wald&#39;, rev=&#39;rows&#39;) # Print out odds ratio and CI OR$measure odds ratio with 95% C.I.

Walds method uses the normal approximation as described above. 11.5.5 Final note on odds ratios The survey example given above would not typically be analysed using odds ratios in real life. Odds ratios are typically employed in case control studies where a typically (rare) disease is being investigated. These studies tend to be retrospective in that cases are found (with the disease) and then controls and the initial circumstances of the cases and controls are compared(Lewallen and Courtright 1998). Controls are created such that they are matched, in some way, to cases, for example by age, sex, smoker etc. The matching factor is not the variable of interest; if it is, it should not be used as a matching criterion. Example A mixed sex group (40 male, 40 female) of patients with a disease X are documented. Another 40 control (without the disease) individuals are matched for age and sex. The numbers with known exposure to, for example, asbestos in each group is determined (see table below). Disease No disease Sum Asbestos 31 1 32 No asbestos 9 39 48 Sum 40 40 80 Hence the proportions with and without exposure to asbestos in each group can be obtained. \\[Pr(\\textrm{Asbestos|Disease}) = \\frac{31}{40} = 0.775\\] \\[Pr(\\textrm{Asbestos|No disease}) = \\frac{1}{40} = 0.025\\] \\[Pr(\\textrm{No Asbestos|Disease}) = \\frac{9}{40} = 0.225\\] \\[Pr(\\textrm{No Asbestos|No disease}) = \\frac{39}{40} = 0.975\\] Therefore, the odds of exposure to asbestos for the disease group are: \\[\\textrm{Odds}_{\\textrm{Disease}} = \\frac{Pr(\\textrm{Asbestos|Disease})}{Pr(\\textrm{Asbestos|No disease})} = \\frac{0.775}{0.225} = 3.444\\] and for the control group: \\[\\textrm{Odds}_{\\textrm{No disease}} = \\frac{0.025}{0.975} = 0.026\\] Hence, the odds ratio is \\[\\textrm{Odds ratio} = \\frac{3.444}{0.026} = 134.333\\] Confidence intervals can be created as before: \\[\\log(134.333)\\pm 1.959964 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{31}+\\frac{1}{1}+\\frac{1}{9}+\\frac{1}{39}}\\] \\[4.9 \\pm 1.959964 \\times 1.081\\] resulting in values of 2.7812 and 7.0195 which, exponentiated, gives a 95% confidence interval of (16.1, 1118.2) - clear evidence of an association between asbestos and the disease.

The control group (n = 98) did not have cancer and 80 were characterised as bald. The question of interest here, is whether baldness predicts prostate cancer?

Q11.6 What about the probability of cancer given baldness and the probability of cancer given no baldness? Is it legitimate to compare these proportions? Hint: think about the independence of individuals within the groups being compared. Q11.7 What method (direct comparison of proportions or odds ratios) would you use to analyse these data and why? 11.6 Summary Proportions are often incorrectly treated in the scientific literature so it is useful to know how to handle such statistics. There are other ways to handle cross classified count data. One of which we will consider in the material on \\(\\chi^{2}\\) test. 11.6.1 Learning outcomes At the end of this chapter you should be able to: recognise that a problem involves proportions, construct an appropriate confidence interval for a proportion and a difference between proportions, construct a significance test testing the difference between proportions, and have a basic understanding of odds ratios. 11.7 Answers Q11.1 There are certainly two outcomes for each trial (seen or not seen). Within a phase we can assume there is the same probability of success. There are fixed number of trials (sampling localities) but they may not be independent as sampling locations close to each other may have similar characteristics. Q11.2 This is sampling situation B, one sample with several mutually exclusive categories, i.e. there is one sample of students and they chose one from many categories of films. Q11.3 This is sampling situation A, two independent samples; one of first years and the other second years. Q11.4 This is sampling situation C, one sample with many yes/no items, i.e. there is one sample of students and for each film genre listed, they indicate whether they enjoy the genre or not. Q11.5 The \\(Pr(\\textrm{Bald|Cancer})\\) = 49/101 and \\(Pr(\\textrm{Bald|No Cancer})\\) = 80/98 (although presumably no one is too concerned about male pattern baldness given a diagnosis of cancer!). Q11.6 The \\(Pr(\\textrm{Cancer|Bald})\\) = 49/129 and \\(Pr(\\textrm{Cancer|Not bald})\\) = 52/70 are the statistics of interest. In the previous question the two groups being compared were Cancer and No cancer; individuals were allocated to each of these groups based on their prognosis. In this question, the two groups being compared are Bald and Not bald. The two proportions cannot be legitimately compared because individuals within the two groups have been matched in some way; for example, there are 129 subjects classed as bald, but this group consists of subjects (with and without cancer) and these individuals have been matched in some way (i.e. they have similar characteristics) and are therefore not independent. Q11.7 The control group does not reflect the occurrence of cancer in the general population (because they have been chosen by virtue of not having cancer) and so there would be no value in directly comparing the probabilities anyway. However, the odds ratio does allow us to explore the relative odds of getting cancer.

We can still ask questions of these data to test hypotheses and the general approach is similar to that previously described but the reference distribution used is a \\(\\chi^2\\) (pronounced chi-square) distribution. Chi-square tests on contingency tables look at the distributions of counts over the cells (in the table) and we ask does a particular row or column distribution differ significantly from some other distribution. We consider two different types of test; a goodness-of-fit test used on a one-way table and a test of independence used on a cross-tabulation. As usual, the validity of conclusions based on these tests rely on some assumptions being met and these are described. 12.2 \\(\\chi^2\\) goodness-of-fit test As a motivating example, we consider data collected from the Scottish Schools Adolescent Lifestyle and Substance Use Survey (SALSUS) established by the Scottish Executive to monitor substance use among young people in Scotland. School pupils in independent and local authority schools were targeted and the data we use are from 2002 - the total sample size was 22,246 pupils. Pupils were asked to record the ethnic group to which they identified, (note that the groups were then combined into five broad categories); the numbers in each group are shown in Table 12.1. Table 12.1: Observed numbers of school pupils in each ethnic group. Group Frequency White 21249 Asian 408 Black 113 Mixed 204 Other 272 Total 22246 We want to assess the similarity of the ethnicity recorded in the SALSUS sample to that of the population in Scotland. Table 12.2 shows the proportions of the ethnic groups recorded in the census. Table 12.2: Proportion of the population of Scotland in each ethnic group obtained from the census. Group Proportion White 0.9726 Asian 0.018 Black 0.0014 Mixed 0.005 Other 0.003 As for all tests, we have a null (\\(H_0\\)) and alternative hypothesis (\\(H_1\\)). In this case we want to test: \\[H_0: \\textrm{the ethnicity in the sample is the same as the ethnicity in the population}\\] \\[H_1: \\textrm{the ethnicity in the sample is not the same as the ethnicity in the population}\\] The first step is to calculate what frequencies we would expect to see if the sample reflected the census population. These expected frequencies for each group (or cell in the table) can be obtained by: \\[\\textrm{Expected value} = \\textrm{total sample size} \\times \\textrm{expected cell proportion}\\] Thus, for the white group, the expected value is \\[ \\textrm{Expected value} = 22246 \\times 0.9726 = 21636.46\\] These expected values can be obtained for all groups (Table 12.3). Table 12.3: The observed frequencies from the SALSUS and the expected values according to the census. Group Frequency Expected White 21249 21636 Asian 408 400.4 Black 113 31.14 Mixed 204 111.2 Other 272 66.74 To determine whether the sample data are consistent with the null hypothesis, we calculate a measure of difference between the observed and expected counts using the chi-square test statistic: \\[\\chi_{stat}^2 = \\sum_{\\textrm{all cells}} \\frac{(\\textrm{observed count} - \\textrm{expected count})^2}{\\textrm{expected count}}\\] This formula is frequently abbreviated to: \\[\\chi_{stat}^2 = \\sum_{\\textrm{all cells}} \\frac{(\\textrm{O} - \\textrm{E})^2}{\\textrm{E}}\\] A key component to this statistic is a simple (squared) distance between what is predicted by our theory (in this case the census), and what we observed in our sample (i.e. O-E in the formula). The chi-square component for the White group is: \\[\\chi_{white}^2 = \\frac{(21249 - 21636.46)^2}{21636.46}= 6.938\\] The \\(\\chi^2\\) contributions are calculated for all ethnic groups (Table 12.4). Table 12.4: Chi-square components (column Chi) for each ethnic group. Group Frequency Expected Chi White 21249 21636 6.939 Asian 408 400.4 0.1432 Black 113 31.14 215.1 Mixed 204 111.2 77.37 Other 272 66.74 631.3 The \\(\\chi^2\\) values for each group are added together to give the overall \\(\\chi^2\\)-test statistic. \\[\\chi_{stat}^2 = 6.939 + 0.1432 + 215.14 + 77.37 + 631.3 = 930.9\\] As with other hypothesis tests, the larger the test statistic, the stronger the evidence against \\(H_0\\). Therefore, we wish to know if this test statistic (i.e. \\(\\chi_{stat}^2 = 930.9\\)) is considered large, if the null hypothesis is true. To determine this, we compare it to a reference distribution; not surprisingly, for a \\(\\chi^2\\) test, the reference distribution is a \\(\\chi^2\\) distribution. The \\(\\chi^2\\) distribution is indexed by one parameter, the degrees of freedom, found from (for a one-way table): \\[\\textrm{df} = \\textrm{number of categories} - 1 \\] The \\(\\chi^2\\) distribution takes different shapes according to the degrees of freedom. You can explore these in Figure 12.1. There is also a live version here Figure 12.1: Exploring the \\(\\chi^2\\) distribution. You can see a live version by clicking here We have 5 ethnic groups and so \\[\\textrm{df} = 5 - 1 = 4\\] The reference distribution (\\(\\chi^2_{df=4}\\)) is shown in Figure 12.2. Figure 12.2: Reference distribution, \\(\\chi^2_{df=4}\\). The red shaded area shows the critical region, testing at a 5% significance level. Note that only one tail is used. We can see that values most likely to occur are around 2 to 6 and testing at a significance level of 5%, the critical value is 9.49. Hence, a value of 930.9 is very untypical and, indeed the exact probability associated with this test statistic is pretty much zero. Hence, we have strong evidence against \\(H_0\\); the observed numbers in the ethnic groups from the sample do not represent what we would expect according to the census. We can go further and investigate what gave rise to such a large test statistic; \\(\\chi^2\\) components for the Black and Other groups were particularly large. The observed number in the Other group was 272 pupils, but according to the census, we expected 67 pupils in this group, hence this large discrepancy led to the large \\(\\chi^2\\) component. Thus, pupils identified as Other and Black were over-represented in the sample compared to the population. This may be due to biased sampling or changing demographics in the population. 12.2.1 Doing this in R To perform a \\(\\chi^2\\) test in R, we need to provide the observed values and the proportions under the null hypothesis (note, the proportions need to sum to 1). # Groups Group &lt;- c(&quot;White&quot;,&quot;Asian&quot;,&quot;Black&quot;,&quot;Mixed&quot;,&quot;Other&quot;) # Observed frequencies from SALSUS Frequency &lt;- c(21249, 408, 113, 204, 272) # Proportions in each group from census CensusProp &lt;- c(0.9726, 0.018, 0.0014, 0.005, 0.003) # Chi-square test - save to new object salsusTest &lt;- chisq.test(x=Frequency, p=CensusProp) salsusTest Chi-squared test for given probabilities data: Frequency X-squared = 930.91, df = 4, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16 The new test statistic object contains some useful information, such as the expected values: # Expected values salsusTest$expected [1] 21636.4596 400.4280 31.1444 111.2300 66.7380 Unfortunately, the test statistic object does not contain the \\(\\chi^2\\) components but these can easily be calculated: # Save expected values Expected &lt;- salsusTest$expected # Chi-square values for each group (Frequency - Expected)^2/Expected [1] 6.9385169 0.1431848 215.1378499 77.3736663 631.3118260 The critical value associated with testing at a fixed significance level can be found using the following command. Note that the distribution is not symmetric and so we want the area in the right hand tail. # Critical value, testing at a 5% significance level qchisq(p=0.05, df=4, lower.tail=FALSE) [1] 9.487729 The exact \\(p\\)-value can be found using: # Exact p-value for test statistic pchisq(q=930.9, df=4, lower.tail=FALSE) [1] 3.360768e-200 Q12.1 A curious child was interested in determining whether a six-sided die was fair and threw the die 60 times and recorded the result each time. The observed frequency distribution is given below. Number Frequency 1 8 2 7 3 9 4 19 5 7 6 10 a. State the null and alternative hypotheses for a chi-square goodness-of-fit test. b. For the null hypothesis is part a, what are the expected values? c. Calculate a suitable test statistic. d. Using the following information, what do you conclude? qchisq(p=0.05, df=5, lower.tail=FALSE) [1] 11.0705 e. The child is not convinced by these results of the statistical test. What might they do to convince themselves? 12.3 \\(\\chi^2\\) test of independence Previously we described a test for a one-way table. Sometimes we have a cross-tabulation, or two-way table. Consider the following data (Table 12.5) tabulating support for Democratic, Republican or Independent candidates by gender (taken from (Agresti 2007)). Table 12.5: Numbers of supporters for each political party by gender. Gender Democrat Independent Republican Female 762 327 468 Male 484 239 477 In total there are 2,757 individuals in the sample. A question that might arise is whether there is more female support for Democrats than Republicans, for example. Indeed there are more female supporters for Democrats than Republicans in our sample, but there were also more Democrats in the sample. Even adjusting for this, another sample would give different frequencies and so is the difference explicable by sampling variability or is there a relationship between political support and gender? We wish to determine whether there is a relationship, or association, between political support and gender or whether gender and political support are independent of one another. The null hypothesis we test assumes that the two variables are independent (hence a test of independence). In this example, the null hypothesis is: \\[H_0: \\textrm{gender and voting intention are independent}\\] The alternative hypothesis states the opposite view. \\[H_1: \\textrm{gender and voting intention are not independent, i.e. there is an association}\\] As before, we calculate expected counts assuming that \\(H_0\\) is true. In this case, the probability of being in a particular cell, is the probability of being in the particular row, multiplied by the probability of being in the particular column (remember \\(P(A \\cap B) = P(A) \\times P(B)\\) for independent events). Thus, the expected count for each cell in the table is given by \\[\\textrm{Expected value} = \\frac{\\textrm{row total}}{\\textrm{grand total}} \\times \\frac{\\textrm{column total}}{\\textrm{grand total}} \\times \\textrm{grand total}\\] where the grand total is the overall total (or sample size). Some values can be cancelled out and so the formula is abbreviated to: \\[\\textrm{Expected value} = \\frac{\\textrm{row total} \\times \\textrm{column total}}{\\textrm{grand total}} \\] To use this formula in our example, we need the necessary totals (Table 12.6). Table 12.6: Numbers of supporters for each political party by gender with the row and column totals added. Gender Democrat Independent Republican Total Female 762 327 468 1557 Male 484 239 477 1200 Total 1246 566 945 2757 Thus, the expected number of female Democrat supporters is: \\[\\textrm{Expected value} = \\frac{1557 \\times 1246}{2757} = 703.67\\] The expected number of male Democrat supporters is: \\[\\textrm{Expected value} = \\frac{1200 \\times 1246}{2757} = 542.33\\] We do this for all cells in the table (Table 12.7): Table 12.7: Expected numbers of supporters for each political party by gender. Gender Democrat Independent Republican Female 703.7 319.6 533.7 Male 542.3 246.3 411.3 As before, the test statistic (\\(\\chi_{stat}^2\\)) is given by \\[\\chi_{stat}^2 = \\sum_{\\textrm{all cells}} \\frac{(\\textrm{O} - \\textrm{E})^2}{\\textrm{E}}\\] The chi-square component for the female Democrat supporters is thus: \\[\\frac{(762 - 703.67)^2}{703.67} = 4.84\\] The chi-square values for all cells are shown in Table 12.8. Table 12.8: Chi-square values for political support by gender. Gender Democrat Independent Republican Female 4.835 0.169 8.084 Male 6.273 0.22 10.49 Thus, the test statistic is: \\[\\chi^2_{stat} = 4.835 + 0.169 + 8.084 + 6.273 + 0.220 + 10.489 = 30.07\\] We need to compare this to a \\(\\chi^2\\) reference distribution; the degrees of freedom are found from: \\[ \\textrm{df} = (\\textrm{number of rows}-1) \\times (\\textrm{number of columns}-1) \\] The data in this example is a \\(2 \\times 3\\) table, thus the degrees of freedom are: \\[ df = (2-1) \\times (3-1) = 2\\] The reference distribution, \\(\\chi^2_{df=2}\\), is shown in Figure 12.3. Figure 12.3: Reference distribution, \\(\\chi^2_{df=2}\\). The red shaded area shows the critical region, testing at a 5% significance level. The red shaded area in Figure 12.3 indicates that the critical value is 5.99 and so since the test statistic is greater than this, we reject the null hypothesis. There is evidence to suggest that gender is not independent of political support. If we examine the \\(\\chi^2\\) components (Table 12.8), we see that the largest components were for Republicans and then Democrats. There were less female Republicans and more male Republicans than expected given the null hypothesis; the converse was true for Democrats. 12.3.1 Doing this in R The key to performing a \\(\\chi^2\\) test of independence is getting the data into the correct matrix form and so it is useful to print it out before going ahead with the test. # Create data voters &lt;- c(762,327,468,484,239,477) # Convert to a matrix voters.mat &lt;- matrix(voters, nrow=2, ncol=3, byrow=TRUE) voters.mat [,1] [,2] [,3] [1,] 762 327 468 [2,] 484 239 477 # Chi-square test of independence chisq.test(x=voters.mat) Pearson&#39;s Chi-squared test data: voters.mat X-squared = 30.07, df = 2, p-value = 2.954e-07 Note that for 2 \\(\\times\\) 2 tables, a correction is applied by default in the chisq.test function. The reason for this is that we assume a discrete distribution can be approximated by continuous distribution (i.e. the \\(\\chi^2\\) distribution). To account for this approximation, an adjustment is made to the formula to calculate \\(\\chi_{stat}^2\\) which makes the test statistic smaller, and thus the corresponding \\(p\\)-value will be larger. Q12.2 A student newspaper (The Saint, 02/02/2019) conducted a survey using social media platforms to determine whether students were in favour of the UK holding a second referendum on Brexit. A statistics student wanted to determine whether voting preference was different on the two social media platforms. The numbers of students who voted are given in the following table. Platfom Yes No Facebook 158 61 Twitter 19 11 a. State a suitable null and alternative hypothesis of a statistical test to determine whether voting preference was different between the social media platforms. b. Calculate the expected counts, assuming that voting preference was not related to social media platform. c. Calculate an appropriate test statistic for the test described in part (a). d. If the exact \\(p\\)-value associated with the test statistic calculated in part (c) was 0.32, what do you conclude? 12.4 Test assumptions As with other hypothesis tests, \\(\\chi^2\\) tests require that some assumptions are fulfilled in order that the results are reliable.\\(\\chi^2\\) tests are only valid when the data are collected as a random sample or as a number of random samples. They are large sample tests that require the total count for the table to be sufficiently large. The following rules of thumb help ensure we dont use \\(\\chi^2\\) tests for samples which are too small: each expected cell count should be greater than 1 80% (at least) of the expected counts should be at least 5. If these rules do not hold, then the categories may be combined in some sensible way to achieve acceptable cell counts. 12.5 Summary Although discrete data are summarised and treated differently to continuous data, the approach to hypothesis testing is the same; the null and alternative hypotheses are stated, a test statistic is calculated and then compared to a reference distribution. \\(\\chi^2\\) tests are used for discrete data in the form of contingency tables. 12.5.1 Learning outcomes In this chapter you have seen how to undertake a: test for goodness of fit to some distribution, and test for independence/association. 12.6 Answers Q12.1 In this example, we conduct a goodness-of-fit test to check whether the die is fair.

The total number of throws was 60. Thus, if each number is equally likely (i.e. with probability \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\)) we would expect each number to be thrown 10 times (for a sample of size 60).

The information provided in the R output was a critical value, testing at a significance level of 5% (i.e. \\(\\chi^2_{crit}=11.07\\)). The test statistic is smaller (but not by much) than the critical value, thus these data do not provide evidence to reject the null hypothesis.

In this case, we might still be interested in ascertaining whether there is a relationship between the variables and correlation can help. If we want to try and explain one variable with the other variable, we fit a simple linear regression model and this allows us to describe the relationship with an equation. In this chapter we look at the two basic statistical concepts of correlation and simple linear regression. 13.2 Correlation To illustrate the concept of correlation, one might ask the question Is left leg length (LLL) associated with total height of a person? Figure 13.1: Scatterplot of total height and left leg length. Does Figure 13.1 provide evidence that there is an association or correlation, as we say with continuous variables? If you think that plot provided evidence of correlation, what about the data set in Figure 13.2? Figure 13.2: Scatterplot of total height and left leg length. What about the data in Figure 13.3? Figure 13.3: Scatterplot of total height and left leg length. It would be useful to have a method to objectively answer these questions. In this case, one undertakes correlation. Correlation asks the question is there a relationship? but not what the relationship is - for that we use regression (which we consider later). Here we will consider linear correlation but there could also be a non-linear relationship and then the statistic of association is called concurvity. Correlation is typically indexed by a correlation coefficient (\\(R\\) or \\(r\\)) which takes a value from -1 to +1 where, -1 indicates a perfect negative relationship, 0 means no relationship and +1 indicates a perfect positive relationship. The statistic \\(r\\) is the estimated (or sample) coefficient of the unknown population correlation coefficient, \\(\\rho\\). There are many types of correlation coefficients, but one frequently used is Pearsons product moment correlation coefficient which, for two continuous variables denoted by \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), is given by: \\[r=\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i-\\bar{x})(y_i-\\bar{y})}{\\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i-\\bar{x})^2\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i-\\bar{y})^2}}\\] where \\(n\\) is the number of observations, \\(x_i\\) and \\(y_i\\) are values for observation \\(i\\), \\(\\bar x\\) and \\(\\bar y\\) are sample means for each variable. Example Consider the contribution of left leg length to human height in a sample of men (using the data in Figure 13.1), we can use R to do the calculation; the variables LLL and TotalHeight are stored in a data frame hgt. \\[r=\\frac{\\sum(diffx)(diffy)}{\\sqrt{\\sum (diffx)^2\\sum(diffy)^2}}\\] where \\(diffx = x_i - \\bar x\\) and \\(diffy = y_i - \\bar y\\). # Manual calculation of r diffx &lt;- hgt$LLL - mean(hgt$LLL) ####differences of x and xbar diffy &lt;- hgt$TotalHeight - mean(hgt$TotalHeight) r &lt;- sum(diffx*diffy)/sqrt(sum (diffx^2)*sum(diffy^2) ) print (r) [1] 0.8675782 Thus, \\(r = 0.868\\); it is close to \\(+1\\) indicating a strong, positive relationship between LLL and total height. The value can also be obtained by using the command cor where you supply it the two vectors of interest. cor(hgt$TotalHeight, hgt$LLL) [1] 0.8675782 An alternative formula for the sample product-moment correlation coefficient is \\[r= \\frac{\\frac{\\sum (x-\\bar{x})(y-\\bar{y})}{n-1}}{s_xs_y}\\] Or assuming the population correlation coefficient is of interest \\[\\rho= \\frac{\\frac{\\sum (x-\\bar{x})(y-\\bar{y}}{N}}{\\sigma_x\\sigma_y}\\] The numerator here is called the covariance of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) and so an alternative way to describe the formula is: \\[r = \\frac{Cov(xy)}{\\sqrt{Var(x)Var(y)}}\\] Q13.1 I have two random variables \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\). The variances of these variables are 2.5 and 4, respectively, and their covariance is -2.5. What is the correlation between these two variables? Q13.2 Suppose I was to create a new random variable \\(Z=X + Y\\) from the previous question. What would be the consequence to the variance estimate of \\(Z\\) if I were to ignore the covariance of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) (assuming X and Y actually were correlated)? 13.2.1 Significance of \\(r\\) Just like other statistics \\(r\\) can have a significance associated with it. The test is typically whether \\(\\rho\\), the unknown population correlation coefficient, is different from one. So \\[H_0: \\rho = 0\\] \\[H_1: \\rho \\neq 0\\] In fact, the significance is generated by a \\(t\\) test statistic with \\(n-2\\) degrees of freedom: \\[t = \\frac{r \\times \\sqrt{n-2}}{\\sqrt {1-r^2}}\\] In the case of the correlation of total height and left leg length, \\(r = 0.868\\) and \\(n=100\\) so \\[t = \\frac{0.868 \\times \\sqrt{100-2}}{\\sqrt {1-0.868^2}}= \\frac{8.593}{0.497} = 17.289\\] The significance level associated with this test statistic is found from: 2*pt(q=17.289, df=98, lower.tail=FALSE) ###assuming a two-tailed test [1] 1.583346e-31 Such a small \\(p\\)-value is perhaps not surprising in this case where \\(r\\) is close to one. The confidence intervals for \\(\\rho\\), the unknown population correlation coefficient are actually quite complicated involving a transformation of \\(r\\) to normalise it, then adding/subtracting an equivalent of the \\(se \\times t_{\\alpha/2, df}\\) term seen so frequently throughout this module, and then back-transforming back to scale of \\(r\\). Unsurprisingly there is a function in R to compute the CI and conduct the hypothesis test. cor.test (hgt$TotalHeight, hgt$LLL) Pearson&#39;s product-moment correlation data: hgt$TotalHeight and hgt$LLL t = 17.27, df = 98, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16 alternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0 95 percent confidence interval: 0.8090244 0.9090815 sample estimates: cor 0.8675782 13.2.2 Correlation and causation The causal correlation fallacy is the idea that just because there is a correlation, or indeed association, (in the case of categorical variables) between two (or more) sets of variables then there is a causal link. Obviously, causality implies correlation but correlation does not necessarily imply causation. Variables might be correlated by chance another third variable which affects them both. genuine causation. Figure 13.4 shows Anscombes quartet, a series of famous data sets that show identical correlation coefficients but probably negligible causation! The correlation of the first pair of variables, \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\), is shown below.

Figure 13.4: Anscombes four regressions; the correlation coefficient is the same in each plot. Figure 13.5 shows a slightly more modern version from the R library datasauRus. All the following data have an approximately identical albeit low \\(r\\) (Table 13.1). Figure 13.5: Scatterplots for variables in the DatasauRus package.

Does this support a causal link between healthy breakfast cereals and weight loss? 13.3 Regression Correlation asks the question Is there a (linear) relationship? A more interesting question might be Is there a (linear) relationship and what is it? i.e. what is our best estimate of the equation relating the two variables; linear regression allows us to do this. Here we will explore this using the environmental impact assessment (EIA) data and other datasets we have already encountered, for example, we might use variables in the EIA data to predict depth (Depth) at a particular location. Regression is a way to study relationships between variables. There are three main reasons why we may want to do this: Description: It can be useful to describe relationships (without necessarily really explaining them. For example a spatial map of an animal species for example. Explanation: Genuine interest in the nature of the relationship between variables e.g. How is depth and penguin density related? Prediction: Using variables to predict others (e.g. using DistCoast to predict Depth) Linear regression models: contain explanatory (sometime called independent) variable(s) which help us explain or predict the behaviour of the response variable. assume constantly increasing, or decreasing, relationships between each explanatory variable and the response. In simple linear regression, we consider only one explanatory variable in the regression model. 13.3.1 Exploratory data analysis To analyse the EIA data properly would require some more advanced methods, but we can illustrate the basic principles of simple linear regression with these data. First, we consider a potential relationship between the distance from the coast and the depth of the water (fairly trivial but it will illustrate the methods): We want to use a function of distance from coast to explain depth. Visualising the relationship between two numeric (and continuous) variables suggests using a scatterplot. By convention, we put distance from coast on the \\(x\\)-axis because this is the explanatory variable (and the function we are after is \\(y=f(x)\\)). Figure 13.6: Relationship of distance to coast and depth. The scatterplot (Figure 13.6) tells us: waters nearer the shore are shallower there is a positive relationship (i.e. as distance to coast increases so does the depth) (there are also stripes, which is interesting) How can we formalise this relationship? 13.3.2 Model specification 13.3.2.1 Setting up the model We will first explain this using generic data. Assume there is a variable \\(X\\) and a variable \\(Y\\), which is thought to be potentially dependent on \\(X\\). We can plot them out (Figure 13.7). Figure 13.7: A scatterplot illustrating the relationship between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\). A linear/straight line relationship between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) might be a reasonable starting point; perhaps some lines like those in Figure 13.8 would be a good fit and summarise these data well. Figure 13.8: Scatterplot with examples of possible fitted lines. All the lines shown in Figure 13.8 have the same general form. What we want to do is find the best model. A simple linear regression model has the form: \\[\\textrm{response} = \\textrm{intercept} + \\textrm{slope} \\times \\textrm{explanatory variable} + \\textrm{error}\\] In notation form this can be represented as: \\[y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_i + \\epsilon_i\\] where \\(y_i\\) refers to the individual values of \\(Y\\) indexed by \\(i\\),i.e. i = 1, , n observations. This the response or the dependent variable. \\(x_i\\) refers to the individual values of \\(X\\) indexed by \\(i\\), \\(\\beta_0\\) is the intercept parameter, \\(\\beta_1\\) is the slope parameter, and \\(\\epsilon_i\\) is an error term. We use the data to estimate values for the intercept and slope. 13.3.2.2 The intercept (\\(\\beta_0\\)) The intercept can be thought of in a few ways: The response value (under the model) when the explanatory variable(s) is/are zero Where the regression line cuts the vertical axis The expected value of the response (\\(y_i\\)) when \\(x_i=0\\). 13.3.2.3 The slope (\\(\\beta_1\\)) The slope, or gradient, of the regression line is: the expected change in the response (\\(y_i\\)) when \\(x_i\\) increases by 1 unit. 13.3.2.4 The error term (a model for the noise) A linear regression model might summarise the relationship between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), but not all the observations follow this linear relationship exactly. The error term (\\(\\epsilon_i\\)) allows for deviations from this linear relationship: In the simplest version of regression described here (i.e. one explanatory variable) the error is assumed to be distributed normally in the \\(y\\) dimension i.e. the uncertainty is in the dependent variable not the x variable. The normal distribution has two parameters that describe it, the mean (\\(\\mu\\)) and variance (\\(\\sigma^2\\)). Since we are modelling the mean response, the mean of the differences between the fitted values (line) and the observations is zero . The variance of the errors (\\(\\sigma_e^2\\)) is estimated as a part of the linear model fitting process. This can be summarised as \\(\\epsilon_i \\sim N(0, \\sigma_e^2)\\). 13.3.3 Which straight line to choose? There are many possible straight lines as we saw in Figure 13.8: We want values of \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\) that look most plausible in light of our data We want \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\) which give the best fitting line - the regression line. We can use least-squares to find the best fitting regression line. 13.3.3.1 The Least Squares (LS) criterion A variety of criteria could be used to fit a best fit line. One often used criterion is the least squares criterion. We want to choose values for the parameters that minimise the sum of the squared differences between the observed data (\\(y_i\\)) and the predictions under the model (\\(\\hat{y}_i\\)). The LS criterion finds parameter estimates which minimise this: \\[\\sum_{i=1}^n (data-model)^2=\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i-\\hat{y}_i)^2 = SS_{Res} \\] The solid line in Figure 13.9 (our model for the signal) will be as close as we can get to the data (on average, based on vertical distances). Other fitted lines (e.g. like the red dashed line) will have a far higher sum of squared differences \\(SS_{Resl}\\). Note other (possibly non linear) models may be better, but this is our best straight line model. The vertical distances between the observed data and the best fit line are called residuals. The least square criterion obtains a line that minimises the summed squares of the residuals, typically abbreviated to the sum of squares. Figure 13.9: A simple X-Y scatterplot with different regression lines; best fit line (black line), less optimal line (red dashes). The vertical differences (shown by the arrows) between the observations and the best fit line are the residuals. Figure 13.10 allows you to choose a best fit line yourself. Can you find the best fit that minimises the sum of the square of the residuals? The red arrows indicate the residual lengths. Figure 13.10: Exploring the line of best fit using residual sums of squares. You can see a live version by clicking here 13.3.4 Fitting the model: the details The slope and intercept estimates can be found from the data using: \\[\\hat{\\beta}_1=\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i-\\bar{x})y_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i-\\bar{x})^2}\\] \\[\\hat{\\beta}_0=\\bar{y} - \\hat{\\beta}_1\\bar{x}\\] where \\(\\bar{x}\\) is the mean of the explanatory variable and \\(\\bar{y}\\) is the mean of the response. Least squares is a useful criterion and it has another advantage; the least squares estimate for the gradient is also the maximum likelihood estimator for the gradient which has theoretical usefulness in more advanced applications. 13.3.5 Predictions Having obtained estimates for \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\), they can be used to obtain predicted, or fitted, values of the response: \\[\\hat{y_i}=\\hat{\\beta}_0+\\hat{\\beta}_1x_{i}\\] We can then estimate \\(Y\\) for any given value of \\(X\\) (within reason). 13.3.6 The variance estimate We can find the variance estimate for the error term (\\(\\sigma_e^2\\)) as follows: \\[\\begin{equation} s^2 = \\hat{\\sigma_e}^2=\\frac{1}{n-k-1}\\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-\\hat{y}_i)^2 \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\hat{y}_i\\) are the fitted values, \\(n\\) is the number of observations, \\(k\\) is the number of slope parameters estimated (in simple linear regression \\(k=1\\)). This estimate (\\(s=\\sqrt{s^2}\\)) is provided as the Residual Standard Error in the R output (see later): Remember, our model for noise is a single normal distribution - so this value indicates how wide/variable this distribution is. The model for noise implies points tend to be near the line; less likely to be far away (i.e. because the residuals are assumed to have a normal distribution with a mean of zero). However, this value is not the uncertainty on any given prediction from the model, see Chapter 17 for details on that. 13.3.7 Introduction to the matrix form There is another way to consider the simple linear regression model which allows for efficient notation and reflects how the best fit line is fitted in practice, as well as allowing computation of more complicated models in the future. The generic equation of the line can be given as: \\[ Y_i = \\beta_0+\\beta_1 X_i + \\epsilon_i \\] where \\(Y_i\\) is the \\(i\\)th \\(Y\\) variable and \\(X_i\\) is the \\(i\\)th predictor and \\(\\epsilon_i\\) the error associated with the \\(i\\)th point. For each datum in turn this would be \\[ Y_1 = \\beta_0+\\beta_1 X_1 + \\epsilon_1 \\] \\[ Y_2 = \\beta_0+\\beta_1 X_2 + \\epsilon_2 \\] \\[ Y_3 = \\beta_0+\\beta_1 X_3 + \\epsilon_3 \\] etc. The \\(Y\\)s can be considered as single vector \\[ \\mathbf{Y} = \\left[\\begin{array} {r} Y_1 \\\\ Y_2 \\\\ \\vdots\\\\ Y_n \\end{array}\\right] \\] Likewise the right-hand side of the equation can be broken up as \\[ \\left[\\begin{array} {r} \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 \\\\ \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\beta_0+\\beta_1 X_n \\end{array}\\right] + \\left[\\begin{array} {r} \\epsilon_1 \\\\ \\epsilon_2 \\\\ \\vdots\\\\ \\epsilon_n \\end{array}\\right] \\] which can be turned into (for those familiar with matrices and matrix multiplication) \\[ \\left[\\begin{array} {rr} 1 &amp; X_1 \\\\ 1 &amp; X_2 \\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots\\\\ 1 &amp; X_n \\end{array}\\right] \\left[\\begin{array} {r} \\beta_0 \\\\ \\beta_1 \\\\ \\end{array}\\right] + \\left[\\begin{array} {r} \\epsilon_1 \\\\ \\epsilon_2 \\\\ \\vdots\\\\ \\epsilon_n \\end{array}\\right] \\] If \\[ \\mathbf{X} = \\left[\\begin{array} {rr} 1 &amp; X_1 \\\\ 1 &amp; X_2 \\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots\\\\ 1 &amp; X_n \\end{array}\\right] \\] \\[ \\mathbf{\\beta} = \\left[\\begin{array} {r} \\beta_0 \\\\ \\beta_1 \\\\ \\end{array}\\right] \\] and \\[ \\mathbf{\\epsilon} = \\left[\\begin{array} {r} \\epsilon_1 \\\\ \\epsilon_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\epsilon_n \\end{array}\\right] \\] Then we get \\[ \\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{X}\\boldsymbol{\\beta} + \\mathbf{\\epsilon}\\] Which for our fitted regression would be: \\[ \\hat{\\mathbf{y}} = \\mathbf{X} \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} \\] Which is simply \\(y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_i\\), for all values of \\(i\\) in an economic way which allows scope for future complexity. To illustrate matrix calculations, we fit a simple regression to eight observations: set.seed(345) x &lt;- runif(8) y &lt;- 2 + x*2 + rnorm(8) smallLM &lt;- lm(y ~ x) plot(x, y) abline(coef(smallLM)) modelEst &lt;- as.vector(coef(smallLM)) modelEst [1] 2.120458 2.763582 The matrix \\(X\\) would be XMat &lt;- cbind(rep(1, 8), x) XMat x [1,] 1 0.2162537 [2,] 1 0.2747640 [3,] 1 0.3899251 [4,] 1 0.6557397 [5,] 1 0.4358664 [6,] 1 0.8034841 [7,] 1 0.3856799 [8,] 1 0.8333017 So if we (matrix) multiply this by the model coefficients we get our predicted values (\\(\\hat{y}\\)). We can see this if we compare the results of the matrix multiplication %*% to the fitted values found from the regression model object. Compare: XMat %*% modelEst [,1] [1,] 2.718093 [2,] 2.879791 [3,] 3.198048 [4,] 3.932649 [5,] 3.325011 [6,] 4.340952 [7,] 3.186316 [8,] 4.423356 to the fitted values: fitted(smallLM) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 2.718093 2.879791 3.198048 3.932649 3.325011 4.340952 3.186316 4.423356 13.3.8 Fitting a simple regression model We can now return to the EIA example and use DistCoast to explain/predict Depth: DistCoast is the explanatory variable (\\(x_i\\)=DistCoast) Depth is the response variable (\\(y_i\\)=Depth) We have 31502 observations (\\(i=1,...,31502\\)) (observations right on the coast line have been removed) However, we have Depth values when Distcoast (\\(x\\)) is close to zero, but this is not guaranteed in many other situations; it is ill-advised to assume a linear relationship holds outside the range of the observed data. In this example, the slope is the change in Depth (in m) for a 1 km increase in distance from the shore: A slope \\(&gt;0\\) indicates a positive/increasing relationship A slope\\(=0\\) indicates no relationship (horizontal line) A slope\\(&lt;0\\) indicates a negative/decreasing relationship Depth is measured on a continuous scale We can start by modelling the differences between the data and the model using a normal distribution. N.B. There is not really a linear response in this example. The relationship looks quite complex so maybe something else is going on. As we shall see, assuming a simple linear model (i.e. a straight line relationship) in this example might be inappropriate. 13.3.8.1 Doing this in R The data have been stored in an object called EIAData. The function used to fit a linear model is lm. # Fit a regression using lm (linear model) depthModel &lt;- lm(Depth ~ DistCoast, data=EIAData) Note that when we write the regression equation we want to fit, we just need to specify \\(\\textrm{response} \\sim \\textrm{explanatory variable}\\). The intercept and gradient terms get included automatically. To look at the output, it is useful to use summary as a wrapper function: summary(depthModel) Call: lm(formula = Depth ~ DistCoast, data = EIAData) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -12.7798 -2.7073 0.1306 2.0266 14.7909 Coefficients: Estimate Std.

Using these functions in R tell you different information about the fitted model. The output from the summary function tells you what the regression coefficients are and whether they are significantly different from zero. # Summary of fitted model summary(depthModel) Call: lm(formula = Depth ~ DistCoast, data = EIAData) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -12.7798 -2.7073 0.1306 2.0266 14.7909 Coefficients: Estimate Std.

A correlation coefficient measures the strength of a linear relationship. A simple linear regression describes the linear relationship when we want to use one variable to explain the other variable. Regression is a useful tool in statistics and can be extended to include many explanatory variables but first we consider the general framework of the linear model. 13.4.1 Learning outcomes At the end of this chapter you should understand: correlation and its constraints the need to be cautious in assigning causation, and simple linear regression. 13.5 Answers Q13.1 Using the \\(r= \\frac{Covar(XY)}{\\sqrt(Var(x))\\sqrt(Var(Y))}\\) formula. \\[r= \\frac{-2.5}{\\sqrt(2.5)\\sqrt(4)} = -0.791\\] Q13.2 If the variance of \\(Z\\) is calculated ignoring the covariance of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), then it will be overestimated as \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are being treated as independent (see earlier chapters for the addition rules for variances).

Essentially the \\(t\\) test, one-way analysis of variance and regression can all be integrated into a single modelling framework. The linear model really developed from a method called ANCOVA (analysis of covariance) developed by the famous geneticist/statistician Ronald Fisher and his co-workers (1927) which allowed analysis of variance (using categorical variables) and regression to be combined into one analysis. Here we show how the linear model can be used to perform some of the tests from earlier in the module. 14.2 The linear model as a \\(t\\) test The linear model can be used to undertake \\(t\\) tests but the data has to be thought of in a slightly different manner. Example Consider the TEON medical dataset; it was data collected to investigate causes of Tanzanian Endemic Optic Neuropathy (TEON) a degenerative disease of the eyes. There is a hypothesis that TEON may be due to vitamin deficiencies. As a reminder of the data, the first six records of the data are shown below: head(meddata) gend age vitdresul vitdc vit.12 vitbc folate TEON teonpres 1 female 50 10.98 insufficiency 310.0 normal 19.17 Yes 1 2 female 39 13.46 insufficiency 238.0 normal 8.16 Yes 1 3 female 39 15.36 insufficiency 361.0 normal 5.55 Yes 1 4 male 28 11.32 low 113.4 low 4.58 Yes 1 5 male 17 5.88 defficiency 313.0 normal 3.18 Yes 1 7 male 26 12.21 insufficiency 986.0 high 16.41 Yes 1 Consider a \\(t\\) test; we want to explore the difference between vitamin D levels in the two TEON groups (presence or absence of TEON). In the commands below, two new objects are created for coding convenience: vitamin D levels where TEON is present (yesteonvitD) and vitamin D where TEON is absent (noteonvitD). require(tidyverse) yesteonvitD&lt;- dplyr::filter(meddata, TEON==&#39;Yes&#39;) %&gt;% dplyr::select(vitdresul) noteonvitD&lt;- dplyr::filter(meddata, TEON==&#39;No&#39;) %&gt;% dplyr::select(vitdresul) # Equivalent to: # noteonvitD&lt;- meddata$vitdresul[meddata$TEON==&#39;No&#39;] Note here were using pipes from tidyr using the tidyverse package (Wickham 2021) and tools from the dplyr libraries using the tidyverse package (Wickham et al. 2021) (both loaded using the tidyverse package) to create the two new objects. Theyre very good for data wrangling. Having the data in the required form, we perform a two sample (two-tailed) \\(t\\) test (assuming equal variances): t.test(x = yesteonvitD, y = noteonvitD, var.equal=TRUE) Two Sample t-test data: yesteonvitD and noteonvitD t = -6.1878, df = 58, p-value = 6.666e-08 alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 95 percent confidence interval: -11.764534 -6.013488 sample estimates: mean of x mean of y 10.69714 19.58615 The results indicate: We have a significant difference ( p-value = \\(6.6e^{-10}\\)) Group yes is \\(19.58-10.697=8.883\\) units lower than group no on average The 95% CI for this is about -11.76 to -6.01. We can write the same a little differently to emphasize the similarity of a two sample \\(t\\) test with linear models - we can think of this as a very general statement of the form: \\[y=f(x)\\] This is interpreted as \\(y\\) is a function of \\(x\\). In our example, \\(y\\) is the vitamin D level and this can be written as a function of the TEON group. The alternative syntax used below highlights this interpretation: # Order TEON levels for comparability meddata$TEON &lt;- relevel(as.factor(meddata$TEON), ref=&quot;Yes&quot;) # Two sample t test as a model t.test(vitdresul ~ TEON, data=meddata, var.equal=TRUE) Two Sample t-test data: vitdresul by TEON t = -6.1878, df = 58, p-value = 6.666e-08 alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 95 percent confidence interval: -11.764534 -6.013488 sample estimates: mean in group Yes mean in group No 10.69714 19.58615 Instead of treating the data as two distinct data sets, we have instead used meddata with vitdresul in one column and the group TEON in another column. We get the same results, but were more explicit by stating \\(y = f(x)\\). Note: We are making sure the groups are ordered to produce the same sign estimates (not very important) We are also not using the Welch-Satterthwaite variant (of the two sample \\(t\\) test), so we can compare to the next model. 14.2.0.1 Using a linear model The same model can be fitted as a simple linear regression model and now we try the same analysis using the lm function. meddata$TEON &lt;- relevel(meddata$TEON, ref=&#39;No&#39;) TEON_lm &lt;- lm(vitdresul ~ TEON, data=meddata) summary(TEON_lm) I have set the baseline level to be the no group, for comparability with previous analysis (i.e. the intercept) The yes group is then estimated relative to the baseline i.e. the mean value for yes is the baseline plus the coefficient given for yes (19.5862 + -8.8890) The model structure is like before \\(y=f(x)\\) (or y ~ x in R code). The signal (\\(f\\)) in this example is very simple - just means based on group membership.

We can create a variable in the medical data called ageTEON with four groups; this tells us whether each patient is: Without TEON and young (age less than the median age of 36) Without TEON and old (age equal to or greater than the median age of 36) With TEON and young (as above) With TEON and old (as above) The output of an \\(F\\) test as in ANOVA to determine any group-based estimate differences in vitamin D levels is shown below: summary(aov(vitdresul ~ ageTEON, data=meddata)) Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F) ageTEON 3 1115 371.5 13.02 1.46e-06 *** Residuals 56 1598 28.5 --- Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 14.3.0.1 Fitting aov as a linear model We can again model this relationship as \\(y = f(x)\\) using lm where \\(x\\) is a categorical variable with more than 2 levels. ageTEON_lm &lt;- lm(vitdresul ~ ageTEON, data=meddata) summary(ageTEON_lm) Call: lm(formula = vitdresul ~ ageTEON, data = meddata) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -10.262 -3.697 -0.345 1.869 20.570 Coefficients: Estimate Std.

The model we want to fit is: \\[\\textrm{vitdresul} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1\\textrm{folate} + \\epsilon\\] Remember for a simple linear regression model: The model for signal is a simple straight line.

We can see that: When folate levels are 0, we estimate mean vitamin D level as 15.44. For each unit increase of folate, we estimate an average increase in Vitamin D as 0.0902. There isnt a statistically significant (linear) relationship between folate and Vitamin D levels ( p-value = 0.45) The amount of variance in the data explained by this model is just about 1.0% (from the Multiple R-squared value) Overall, the model doesnt really explain a significant amount of the variation ( p-value = 0.4498) 14.4.0.1 Looking at the fitted model Lets look at the fitted model - we assume a simple straight line relationship between the response and covariate: We can plot the data (its a simple case) and overlay the fitted model (Figure 14.1). plot(meddata$folate, meddata$vitdresul, xlab=&quot;Folate&quot;, ylab=&quot;Vit.

What does good even mean? Here we look at methods for assessing the goodness of fit of the fitted line. 14.5.0.1 Goodness of fit, \\(R^2\\) One criterion for assessing goodness of fit might be whether the model accurately predicts the observed values. Another way of putting this might be how much of variation observed in the data is explained by the model? To answer this question, we consider the regression as an analysis of variance problem. The variability observed in the data can be partitioned in to the variability explained by model and the variability not explained by the model. We want to know how much of the total observed variation has been explained by the model? The easiest way to do this is to work out the proportion of unexplained variation and subtract from one. \\[R^2=1- \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i-\\hat{y})^2}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i-\\bar{y})^2}\\] the numerator is the square error or residual sum of squares \\(SS_{Res}\\) the denominator is known as the total sum of squares (\\(SS_{Total}\\)). So here to determine the proportion of explained variation we have determined the proportion of the unexplained variation and subtracted it from one. In the summary of depthModel, we see that the multiple R-sq is 0.6903. We can use the anova function output for the depthModel to illustrate the calculation: # Fit a regression using lm (linear model) depthModel &lt;- lm(depth ~ DistCoast, data=workingData) # Summary of model summary(depthModel) Call: lm(formula = depth ~ DistCoast, data = workingData) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -12.5152 -2.7239 0.1013 2.1208 14.7857 Coefficients: Estimate Std.

As in ANOVA seen previously, the \\(F\\) value is the ratio of explained variation (now turned into a variance by dividing by the degrees of freedom) to the unexplained variation (also considered as a variance.) Using the output, \\(R^2\\) is given by: \\[R^2 = 1- \\frac{\\textrm{Residual Sum of Squares}}{\\textrm{Total Sum of Squares}} = 1- \\frac{109881}{244936+109881} = 0.6903\\] Another way of writing \\(R^2\\) is the proportion of variation (measured as sum of squares) explained: \\[R^2 = \\frac{\\textrm{Model Sum of Squares}}{\\textrm{Total Sum of Squares}} =\\frac{244936}{244936+109881} = 0.6903\\] We mentioned before the connection between the t and F statistics in the summary table but there are other connections too. If the residual standard error of the summary table (i.e. \\(4.322\\)) is squared, this gives the Mean sum of squares associated with the residuals in the anova table i.e.\\[ 4.322^2 = 18.7 \\approx 19\\].

However, many systems presumably have multiple inputs so it would be useful to have models that can consider multiple predictors at the same time, both for efficiency and to take into account the relationships those variables might have with each other. In this section we are going to describe multiple linear regression models and illustrate the methods by examining and quantify relationships between the response (density) and the other covariates available in the EIA data set. We will fit some preliminary models, carry out model selection, diagnose model problems and interpret some results (in light of any problems). 14.6.1 The EIA data again Well return to the EIA dataset seen previously. To analyse these data properly would require some more advanced methods, but we can illustrate the basic principles of multiple regression with these data. Recall that data were collected during three different construction phases (A, B and C): We could fit an ANOVA and determine whether there are differences in average densities across phases. If we see compelling (and reliable) differences across average densities in each phase, we would want to be sure that any differences seen across phases are not due to other variables (apart from phase). For instance, if a bird species avoids deep waters and locations with deep water were over-represented in phase C, this could return a lower average density in phase C (compared with the other phases) for this reason alone. Ignoring imbalances like these could lead us to incorrectly conclude that differences across phases are due to the wind farm construction. Therefore, we want to include multiple explanatory variables (covariates) in a linear model: For these (and other) reasons, it makes sense to consider the relationship between density and several covariates simultaneously, even if the primary interest solely lies in changes due to construction phases. We might also gain valuable insights about variables which influence density. 14.6.1.1 Exploratory Data Analysis Scatterplots can be a good way to explore relationships between variables, but over-plotting (several points on top of each other) can make patterns difficult to see and so we might want to use the qplot function in the ggplot2 library: require(ggplot2) require(gridExtra) a&lt;-qplot(Depth, Density, data=workingData, xlab=&quot;Depth (m)&quot;, ylab=&quot;Density&quot;, geom = c(&quot;point&quot;), alpha = I(1 / 5)) b&lt;-qplot(XPos, Density, data=workingData,xlab=&quot;X co-ordinate&quot;, ylab=&quot;Density&quot;, geom = c(&quot;point&quot;), alpha = I(1 / 5)) grid.arrange(a, b, nrow=1) Figure 14.2: Scatterplots for potential model covariates and estimated densities. Figure 14.3: Scatterplots for potential model covariates and estimated densities. Using Figures 14.2 and 14.3, it is very difficult to tell which covariates affect density due to the very large numbers of observations, but speculatively the highest densities seem to be associated with: moderate depths large values of the X-coordinate central values of the Y-coordinate locations near the coast. 14.6.2 Model specification We are going to use multiple covariates to predict density in the survey area using linear regression. There are two main reasons why we may want to do this: Explanation: We may be genuinely interested in finding the relationship between such variables (e.g. what, if any, is the relationship between density and depth?) Prediction: If there is a relationship between the variables under study, then knowledge of some variables will help us predict others (e.g., if we know that density changes with depth on the transects, then knowing the depth of a site will help us predict density off the transects). 14.6.2.1 Candidate covariates Linear models with continuous explanatory variables assume constantly increasing or decreasing relationships between each explanatory variable and the response. We are going to consider the following covariates in the model(s): X-coordinate: the easting co-ordinate of each location (UTM) Y-coordinate: the northing co-ordinate of each location (UTM) Distance from coast: how far each location is from the nearest coast Depth: the depth of the water at each location month: calendar month Since we are also interested in potential changes across phases, we also include: Phase: construction status of the site: baseline (phase=A), installation/operation of the first windfarm (phase=B), installation/operation of the second windfarm (phase=C) It is worth looking at the relationships between pairs of explanatory variables to see if there are any correlations between them (Figure 14.4). Figure 14.4: Scatterplots showing the relationships between explanatory variables. The plots are symmetrical above and below the diagonal. 14.6.2.2 The model for the signal Multiple linear regression models use at least two explanatory variables to predict the response of interest and can be written as: \\[ y_{i} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_{1i} + \\beta_2x_{2i} + \\cdots +\\beta_px_{pi} +\\epsilon_{i} \\tag{14.1} \\] where \\(y_{i}\\) is the response (density for time point \\(i\\) in the EIA case), \\(\\beta_0\\), is the intercept parameter, \\(\\beta_1,\\beta_2\\),,\\(\\beta_p\\) are slope coefficients and \\(x_{1i}, x_{2i},...,x_{pi}\\) are the explanatory variables for each time point (\\(i\\)) \\(\\epsilon_i\\) is the error for time point \\(i\\). 14.6.2.3 The model for the noise While the linear combination of covariates (\\(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_{1i} + \\beta_2x_{2i} +,...,+\\beta_px_{pi}\\)) might describe the relationship between the response and covariates well, it will never describe the response exactly. For this reason, we need to consider the differences between the response and values predicted by the model (the errors; \\(\\epsilon_{i}\\)). For these models, we will assume the collection of these differences (\\(\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}\\)) are well described by a normal distribution with zero mean and some variance, \\(\\sigma^2\\): \\[\\begin{equation} \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon} \\sim N(0,\\sigma^2). \\end{equation}\\] 14.6.3 Types of covariates There can be two types of variable in a linear model. Variables that are continuous and those that are factors with different levels. The latter can be ordered if there are more than two levels. 14.6.3.1 Continuous covariates If we fit a model with XPos, YPos, DistCoast, Depth and Month all as continuous covariates, we have the following model: \\[ y_{i} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_{1i} + \\beta_2x_{2i} +\\beta_3x_{3i} +\\beta_4x_{4i}+\\beta_5x_{5i}+\\epsilon_{i} \\tag{14.2} \\] where \\(y_{i}\\) represents Density at point \\(i\\), \\(x_{1i}\\) represents XPos, \\(x_{2i}\\) represents YPos, \\(x_{3i}\\) represents DistCoast, \\(x_{4i}\\) represents Depth and \\(x_{5i}\\) represents Month. Each slope coefficient (\\(\\beta_1,...,\\beta_5\\)) relates to the expected change in density for a one-unit increase in the covariate. The intercept coefficient (\\(\\beta_0\\)) relates to the expected density when all covariates are equal to zero (which doesnt make sense in this context) as for example Depth cannot be zero. 14.6.3.2 Factor covariates In this example, month can either be considered as a continuous covariate, since it is coded as values 1 to 4, or a categorical (factor) covariate since it contains many repeated values. As it turns out, fitting variables as factors permits the response to vary with the covariate in a nonlinear way so that, in this example, the fitted relationship between density and month can vary by month. As a consequence, this requires more parameters to be estimated because we are no longer estimating just one regression coefficient.The number of parameters is related to the number of factor levels. Factor variables are typically fitted using treatment contrasts; one level of the factor variable forms the baseline and the remaining levels of the factor have corresponding coefficients that need to be estimated which are calculated as differences from the baseline. For example, one `level of month (e.g. the first level) forms the baseline, while the remaining levels have associated coefficients which quantify the difference in the expected value of the response in each month compared with the baseline month (all else being equal). Factors in linear models are implemented in practise using dummy variables which switch on (\\(x=1\\)) or off (\\(x=0\\)) depending on the level of the factor variable. For instance, if we modify the model in Equation (14.2) to include month as a factor (instead of a linear term), month now has three coefficients (month has four values: 14) and the first month forms the baseline: \\[\\begin{equation} y_{i} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_{1i} + \\beta_2x_{2i} +\\beta_3x_{3i} +\\beta_4x_{4i}+\\beta_5x_{5i}+\\beta_6x_{6i}+\\beta_7x_{7i}+\\epsilon_{i} \\tag{14.3} \\end{equation}\\] where: \\(x_{1i}\\) represents XPos, \\(x_{2i}\\) represents YPos, \\(x_{3i}\\) represents DistCoast, \\(x_{4i}\\) represents Depth, \\(x_{5i}=1\\) when Month=2 and \\(x_{5i}=0\\) otherwise (i.e. for any other month), \\(x_{6i}=1\\) when Month=3 and \\(x_{6i}=0\\) otherwise \\(x_{7i}=1\\) when Month=4 and \\(x_{7i}=0\\) otherwise. the intercept coefficient (\\(\\beta_0\\)) represents average density in Month=1 when XPos, YPos, DistCoast and Depth are equal to zero. The fitted model for January is: \\[\\hat{y_{i}}=\\hat{\\beta}_0+\\hat{\\beta}_1x_{1i}+\\hat{\\beta}_2x_{2i}+\\hat{\\beta}_3x_{3i}+\\hat{\\beta}_4x_{4i}\\] The fitted model for February is: \\[\\hat{y_{i}}=\\hat{\\beta}_0+\\hat{\\beta}_1x_{1i}+\\hat{\\beta}_2x_{2i}+\\hat{\\beta}_3x_{3i}+\\hat{\\beta}_4x_{4i}+\\hat{\\beta}_{5}x_{5i}\\] When month=2, \\(x_{5i}=1\\) and when month= 1, 3 or 4, \\(x_{5i}=0\\) . Similarly, the fitted model for April is: \\[\\hat{y_{i}}=\\hat{\\beta}_0+\\hat{\\beta}_1x_{1i}+\\hat{\\beta}_2x_{2i}+\\hat{\\beta}_3x_{3i}+\\hat{\\beta}_4x_{4i}+\\hat{\\beta}_{7}x_{7i}\\] where \\(x_{7i}=1\\) (since month=4 and \\(x_{7i}=0\\) otherwise). 14.6.4 Model fitting Similar to a simple linear regression model, the regression coefficients are estimated from the data using least-squares (LS). 14.6.4.1 Least-Squares Estimating linear model parameters is straightforward using least-squares: We find estimates for \\(\\beta_0\\), \\(\\beta_1\\),, \\(\\beta_p\\) that `best fit the data. We do this by finding values for the parameters that give us model predictions/fitted values (\\(\\hat{y}_{i}\\)) which are closest to our response data (\\({y}_{i}\\)) over all observations. This happens by minimising the sum of the squared difference between the observed data and the values returned by the model: \\[\\begin{align} \\textrm{LS} &amp; = \\sum_{i=1}^{n_i}(y_{i}-\\hat{y}_{i})^2 \\\\ &amp;=\\sum_{i=1}^{n_i}(y_{i}-(\\hat{\\beta}_0 + \\hat{\\beta}_1x_{1i},...,\\hat{\\beta}_px_{pi}))^2 \\\\ \\end{align}\\] 14.6.4.2 Fitting linear models in R Multiple regression models are easily fitted in R with the lm function. For example, Equation (14.2) defined a model with only continuous variables (month is treated here as continuous). It is fitted using the following command: linearStart&lt;- lm(Density ~ XPos + YPos + DistCoast + Depth + Month, data=wfdata) summary(linearStart) Call: lm(formula = Density ~ XPos + YPos + DistCoast + Depth + Month, data = wfdata) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -10.26 -5.14 -3.23 -0.12 1716.69 Coefficients: Estimate Std.

The model coefficients (\\(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}\\)) for the linearAll model can be interpreted as follows: XPos increases by one kilometre, we expect density to increase by 0.117 animals per km\\(^2\\) YPos increases by one kilometre, we expect density to decrease by 0.555 animals per km\\(^2\\) DistCoast increases by one kilometre, we expect density to decrease by 0.315 animals per km\\(^2\\) Depth increases by 1 metre (i.e. becomes 1m deeper) then density is expected to decrease by 0.454 animals per km\\(^2\\) Month is February, rather than January, then density is expected to increase by 0.547 animals per km\\(^2\\) Month is March, rather than January, then density is expected to increase by 3.159 animals per km\\(^2\\) Month is April, rather than January, then density is expected to increase by 0.658 animals per km\\(^2\\) Phase is Phase B, rather than Phase A, then density is expected to decrease by 0.185 animals per km\\(^2\\) Phase is Phase C, rather than Phase A, then density is expected to decrease by 1.536 animals per km\\(^2\\) The intercept in this case includes two baseline levels - the baseline month and the baseline phase and so reflects the expected density for XPos=0, YPos=0, DistCoast=0, Depth=0 in January and Phase A. A nice film about interpreting regression coefficients can found here. 14.6.6 Parameter uncertainty There is uncertainty in the parameter estimates (of course). We have estimates for each regression coefficient (each \\(\\beta_p\\), where \\(p=1,...P\\)) but each time we take a sample (and hence fit a new model), we obtain different estimates (because the data going into the estimators will be different). If there was no genuine relationship between the response and a covariate, we might expect that the estimated value of the regression coefficient would be very close to zero (i.e. hardly any change in the response for a unit increase in the covariate). However, even if there is no genuine relationship between the response and each covariate, the estimate is unlikely to ever be exactly zero. In order to make general statements about model parameters, we can generate ranges of plausible values for these parameters (e.g. confidence intervals) and perform hypothesis tests for these parameters. 14.6.7 Confidence intervals (CIs) on parameters Building CIs for model parameters is very similar to CIs for means, and we will use the \\(t\\) distribution (with \\(df=n-P-1\\)) to give us our multiplier. (The Residual degrees of freedom in the R summary output also gives this df). The information to construct these CIs is provided in the R output, excepting the \\(t\\) multiplier: \\[ \\hat{\\beta}_p \\pm t_{(\\alpha/2, df=n-P-1)} \\times SE_{\\beta_p} \\] For example, the 95% confidence interval (\\(\\alpha=0.05\\)) for the coefficient associated with phaseB is \\[ -0.185 \\pm t_{(0.025, 31492)}\\times 0.361\\] The \\(t\\) multiplier is -1.96 (the \\(t\\) distribution is going to be like the normal distribution because of the high degrees of freedom): \\[ -0.185 \\pm 1.96\\times 0.361\\] (-0.894, 0.523) Note this interval contains zero and so even though the estimate is positive, we cannot say whether average density in phase B is higher, lower, or the same as in phase A (all other things being equal.) 14.6.8 Hypothesis testing The two-sided hypothesis test of no relationship for each covariate (i.e.. \\(H_0: \\beta_p=0\\), \\(H_1: \\beta_p \\neq 0\\)) is performed in the familiar way: \\[ \\textrm{test statistic} = \\frac{\\textrm{data-estimate - hypothesised value}}{ {\\textrm{standard error}}} \\] Data-estimates which are more than about 2 standard errors from the hypothesized value (\\(\\beta_p=0\\) in this case, no real underlying relationship) provide compelling evidence against \\(H_0\\). Example We can test the hypothesis that the coefficient for phase B is equal to 0. Therefore, the test statistic for phaseB coefficient is: \\[ \\textrm{test statistic} = \\frac{-0.18549-0}{0.36145}=-0.513 \\] We can quantify the evidence for the null hypothesis by obtaining an exact \\(p\\)-value for the test statistic: 2*pt(q=-1.916, df=31492) [1] 0.05537414 This \\(p\\)-value suggests we have no/weak evidence against \\(H_0\\) - under repeated sampling we would obtain a test statistic at least this large about 85% of the time even if there is no genuine difference between phases A and B. Testing at a significance level of 5%, we fail to reject the null hypothesis that the coefficient for phase B is different from 0 (since the \\(p\\)-value is larger than 5%). As this coefficient represents the difference between the mean of phase A and phase B then is is effectively a test of the difference between phase A and B. Similar hypothesis tests can be done for all regression coefficients and that is what R has done in the summary output although it may be necessary to relevel categorical variables. These are the t values and Pr(&gt;|t|) values. 14.6.8.1 The importance of considering multiple covariates Based on the linearAll model, we have no evidence that average density is different in phase B (or phase C) compared with phase A, but this result depends on the other covariates included in the model. In this case, if we consider Phase alone in the model (see below), the average density is still not significantly higher in phase B compared with phase A. summary(lm(Density ~ Phase, data=EIAData)) Call: lm(formula = Density ~ Phase, data = EIAData) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -3.89 -3.89 -3.50 -2.48 1721.40 Coefficients: Estimate Std.

Imagine we are interested in understanding the contribution of leg length to human height. We measure left leg length (LLL) and right leg length (RLL) and total height in a sample of men. As one might expect there appears to be a relationship between all 3 variables (Figure 14.5) and as might be expected, there appears to be a significant contribution of leg length to human height.

What is the explanation? The estimated regression coefficients are the slopes given the other terms in the model. In this case, the extra effect of RLL, given LLL is already in the model, is negligible and vice versa. If one knows LLL, RLL tells us nothing because the two variables are so similar (or more precisely correlated). Hence, neither term is significant. We will return to this correlation of the predictors later. In the case of the ANOVA table, the sum of squares act sequentially, so the variation in modelBoth is parcelled out to LLL first and then RLL. In this case LLL is significant, but RLL is not. In the case of modelBoth2, RLL is significant and LLL is not. What is the solution? Perhaps to consider a model with LLL, or RLL, only but not both. Nothing is lost by only including one of these variables in this case, because they really explain the same thing. If RLL and LLL were not closely correlated, then explanative power could be lost by not including them in the model. We shall return to this topic. 14.6.9 Model performance Previously, we calculated \\(R^2\\) value to obtain a measure of goodness of fit. The ordinary \\(R^2\\) (called Multiple R-squared in summary output) should be used cautiously in multiple regression: When adding covariates to a model the (absolute) fit to the data will always improve, even if just a little. So goodness of fit scores (e.g. the squared correlation between the observed and fitted values; the \\(R^2\\)) which ignore the number of parameters used to fit the model should not form the basis for comparison across models with different numbers of covariate. 14.6.9.1 Adjusted \\(R^2\\) In a multiple linear regression model, an adjusted \\(R^2\\) value is often more appropriate than the ordinary \\(R^2\\) value because it takes into account the number of parameters estimated in the model: \\[ \\textrm{Adjusted } R^2 = 1-\\frac{(n-1)(1-R^2)}{n-P-1} \\] where \\(R^2\\) is the squared correlation between the observed (\\({y}_{i}\\)) and fitted values (\\(\\hat{y}_{i}\\)), \\(n\\) is the total number of observations, and \\(P\\) is the number of explanatory variables fitted in the model. An adjusted \\(R^2\\) closer to 1 indicates better predictive power and is shown in the lm output.For more, check out a 4 minute clip on the subject here However, there is a problem with adjusted \\(R^2\\) in that it no longer has a ready interpretation as it can take a value outside of 0 or 1 and no longer relates directly to the explained variation. 14.6.10 More covariates of mixed types Lets consider adding more covariates - mixing the types and return to the medical data.

For each unit increase of folate there is a 0.12 unit increase of vitdresul. The TEON effect is statistically significant. The relationship with folate is not significant. The intercept mean is between 15.58 and 20.9 with 95% confidence. The slope parameter (for folate) is between -0.064 and 0.305 units with 95% confidence (noting 0 is a plausible value here).

This can in turn be re-written as \\[\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} = \\left[\\begin{array} {ccc} 1 &amp; X_{1,1} &amp; X_{2,1}\\\\ 1 &amp; X_{1,2} &amp; X_{2,2}\\\\ ...\\\\ 1 &amp; X_{i,n} &amp; X_{2,n} \\end{array}\\right] \\left[\\begin{array} {r} \\hat{\\beta_0} \\\\ \\hat{\\beta_1} \\\\ \\hat{\\beta_2} \\end{array}\\right] \\] The first matrix on the right hand side is called a design matrix and consists of a column of ones for the intercept and the continuous covariate values in the other columns. 14.7.1 Dummy variables We have already hinted at the form that the categorical variables must take. We just need to augment the design matrix. We create a binary matrix made up of zeros and ones. The 0/1 codings indicate which level of the factor variable (our categorical covariate) each observation belongs to. Each level therefore gets a parameter in the parameter vector. So, say \\(X\\) has 3 levels, with the first 9 values being A,A,A, B,B,B, C,C,C, we might encode the design matrix as: \\[ \\left[\\begin{array} {ccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\\\ 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\\\ 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\right] \\] The default condition is zero, a 1 in the first column means level A, a 1 in the second column means level B and a 1 in the third column means level C. So a simple one-way ANOVA would become \\[ \\hat{\\mathbf{y}} = \\left[\\begin{array} {ccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\\\ 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\\\ 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\right] \\left[\\begin{array} {r} \\hat{\\beta_0} \\\\ \\hat{\\beta_1} \\\\ \\hat{\\beta_2} \\end{array}\\right] = \\left[\\begin{array} {r} \\hat{\\beta_0} \\\\ \\hat{\\beta_0} \\\\ \\hat{\\beta_0} \\\\ \\hat{\\beta_1} \\\\ \\hat{\\beta_1} \\\\ \\hat{\\beta_1} \\\\ \\hat{\\beta_2} \\\\ \\hat{\\beta_2} \\\\ \\hat{\\beta_2} \\end{array}\\right] \\] However, in practice (especially when using the linear model) as we have seen we fit regression coefficients relative to a baseline, such that the other parameters are intercept modifiers. In this example, \\(\\hat{\\beta_1}\\) +\\(\\hat{\\beta_2}\\) are intercept modifiers. So \\(\\hat{\\beta_0}\\) might be the mean of the baseline factor (A) , \\(\\hat{\\beta_1}\\) might be the mean difference between baseline and level 2 (B - A), \\(\\hat{\\beta_2}\\) might be the mean difference between baseline and level 3 (C - A). 14.7.2 Combining factors and continuous variables A continuous variable combined with a factor variable (with 3 levels) then becomes: \\[ \\hat{\\mathbf{y}} = \\left[\\begin{array} {cccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; x_{2,2}\\\\ 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; x_{2,1}\\\\ 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; x_{2,1}\\\\ 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; x_{2,2}\\\\ 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; x_{2,3}\\\\ 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; x_{2,4}\\\\ 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; x_{2,5}\\\\ 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; x_{2,6}\\\\ 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; x_{2,7}\\\\ 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; x_{2,8}\\\\ 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; x_{2,9} \\end{array}\\right] \\left[\\begin{array} {r} \\hat{\\beta_0} \\\\ \\hat{\\beta_1} \\\\ \\hat{\\beta_2} \\\\ \\hat{\\beta_3} \\end{array}\\right]= \\left[\\begin{array} {c} \\hat{\\beta_0} + \\hat{\\beta_3} x_{2,1}\\\\ \\hat{\\beta_0} + \\hat{\\beta_3} x_{2,2}\\\\ \\hat{\\beta_0} + \\hat{\\beta_3} x_{2,3}\\\\ \\hat{\\beta_0} + \\hat{\\beta_1} + \\hat{\\beta_3} x_{2,4}\\\\ \\hat{\\beta_0} + \\hat{\\beta_1} + \\hat{\\beta_3} x_{2,5}\\\\ \\hat{\\beta_0} + \\hat{\\beta_1} + \\hat{\\beta_3} x_{2,6}\\\\ \\hat{\\beta_0} + \\hat{\\beta_2} + \\hat{\\beta_3} x_{2,7}\\\\ \\hat{\\beta_0} + \\hat{\\beta_2} + \\hat{\\beta_3} x_{2,8}\\\\ \\hat{\\beta_0} + \\hat{\\beta_2} + \\hat{\\beta_3} x_{2,9} \\end{array}\\right] \\] With an appropriate fitting object, we now estimate a straight line relationship between \\(x_2\\) and some adjustment for each factor level of \\(x_2\\) just as we did in the cases above.

The model matrix can be extracted from the model object by the model.matrix command. 14.8 Summary The linear model is a very powerful tool. It is a method to explain the variation in a continuous variable in terms of other variables. The linear model can fit simple and multiple linear regression, comparison of two means and one way analysis of variance. The linear model can be extended to include multiple explanatory variables: these can be continuous or (categorical) factors (implemented using dummy variables) or both. Interpreting coefficients for factor variables requires care - they are average differences from some baseline level Goodness of fit of a fitted model can be measured as the proportion of variation explained and its predicted powerbut by itself there may be a flaw in using this solely as the index of model quality (see further chapters). The linear model is a useful tool for exploring variation in univariate data (that is, a single vector of dependent data) potentially influenced by other variables and can be extended in lots of ways. However, with great power comes great responsibility and it is important to make sure linear models are used appropriately. We have not yet considered the assumptions of linear models, nor uncertainty in the predictions, nor what to do when explanatory variables are correlated (which can cause problems in interpretation). These issues are covered in following chapters. 14.8.1 Learning objectives Having worked through this chapter, you should now understand the linear model as a generalisation of other parametric models, how to combine factor and continuous variables into the same analysis, \\(R^2\\) as a measure of goodness of fit, the matrix interpretation of a linear model, and the distinction between sequential and adjusted sums of squares. 14.9 Answers Q14.1 The response variable is vitdresul, i.e. the vitamin D level. Q14.2 The predictor, or explanatory, variable is TEON, the presence or absence of the TEON condition. Q14.3 The latter two analyses assume that the variable TEON explains vitamin D levels. However, it seems more likely that vitamin D levels would explain TEON condition (indeed, that is what we assumed previously). Under these circumstances, TEON should be the response variable and vitamin D level, the explanatory variable. TEON consists of 0 and 1 values (to represent presence/absence of the TEON condition), hence, we would like a form of regression that allowed for binary outcomes (i.e. only two possibilities) to be the response variable: such regression is possible but beyond the remit of this module. Q14.4The linear model assumes a common error variation for all levels of the explanatory factor variable and, in fact, for all levels of continuous variables as well (if there were any). We will explore this later. Q14.5 \\(VitD =\\beta_0+\\beta_1+TEON +\\epsilon\\) where \\(VitD\\) is the dependent variable (response), TEON is the categorical predictor, \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\) are the fitted means for the different TEON levels (and the mean and slope respectively) and \\(\\epsilon\\) is the error term. Q14.6 The columns in the table are: Estimate - estimated regression coefficients for each term in the model. Std. Error - estimated standard errors for each term in the model t value - \\(t\\) test statistics for each term, t value = Estimate/Std. Error Pr(&gt;|t|) - Probability associated with the \\(t\\) test statistics for each term in the model. Q14.7 They are a visual indication an interval level of significance associated with the t-tests for each term in the model. The intervals are: *** 0 - 0.001 ** 0.001 - 0.01 `*0.01 - 0.05.` 0.05 - 0.1 Blank 0.1 - 1.0 In this example, the \\(p\\)-values for both the intercept and slope are small (between 0 and 0.001) and so there are three asterisks. Q14.8 TEON = No: = 19.5862; TEON = Yes: 19.5862-8.889 = 10.6972. Q14.9 TEON = Yes, therefore estimated VitD is 19.5862 - 8.8890 = 10.6972 units. Q14.10 The degrees of freedom of the residuals are given by \\(n - P - 1 = 58\\), where \\(n\\) = number of observations, \\(P\\) = number of coefficients in the model (excluding the intercept). Therefore, \\(n = 58 + P + 1\\). In this model, there is only one explanatory variable and so \\(P = 1\\), hence \\(n = 60\\). Q14.11 The confidence interval for the TEON=Yes parameter is given by: \\[\\beta_1 \\pm \\alpha_0.025 \\times s.e.\\] \\[ -8.889 \\pm 2.001717 \\times 1.4365\\] \\[ -8.889 \\pm 2.875467\\] (-11.7645,-6.0135) Q14.13 There are several options: We need to obtain the probability associated with values less than -6.188 (i.e. left hand tail of the distribution) and values greater than 6.188 (i.e. right hand tail). pt(q=-6.188, df=58) + pt(q=6.188, df=58, lower.tail=FALSE) Alternatively, the area in each tail could just be multiplied by two because the t-distribution is symmetric. 2*pt(q=-6.188, df=58) or 2*pt(q=6.188, df=58, lower.tail=FALSE Q14.14 The fitted equations are: TEON = No: \\[-18.24054 + 0.12042.\\textrm{TEON}\\] TEON = Yes: \\[-18.24054 -8.98669 + 0.12042.\\textrm{TEON} = - 9.25385 + 0.12042.\\textrm{TEON} \\] Q14.15 TEON = No and folate = 2, therefore, estimated VitD = 18.24054 + 0.12042 = 18.48 units Q14.16 TEON = 1 and folate = 3, therefore, estimated VitD = 9.25385 + 0.12042*3 = 9.62 units References "],["modelselection.html", "Chapter 15 Model selection 15.1 Introduction 15.2 Collinearity 15.3 \\(p\\)-value based model selection: the \\(F\\) test 15.4 Relative model fit 15.5 Other methods of model selection 15.6 Automated variable selection 15.7 Example: model selection with the medical data 15.8 Summary 15.9 Answers", " Chapter 15 Model selection 15.1 Introduction If there is only one, or a small number of possible explanatory variables (also known as covariates, predictors or independent variables) choosing a linear regression model can be straightforward. What happens when there are many explanatory variables? Some covariates may be more important/useful than others in explaining the response variable. Since conclusions depend, to some extent, on the covariates in the linear model, how do we decide which covariates to include? This chapter considers how to choose between competing models using different model selection procedures: \\(p\\)-values, fit scores and automated methods. The concepts described in this chapter use examples introduced in Chapter 14. 15.1.1 Criteria for model selection We want to have an appropriate set of covariates in our model: if we include too few variables we throw away valuable information, and if we include non-essential variables the standard errors and \\(p\\)-values tend to be too large. if the models are too simple (under-fitted), or too complex (over-fitted), the models will have poor predictive abilities. We want to include variables which: have a genuine relationship with the response and offer a sufficient amount of new information about the response (given the variables already included) We want to exclude variables that: offer essentially the same information about the response; e.g., we want to avoid collinearity. 15.2 Collinearity Collinearity is a linear association between two variables in a linear regression model. Multicollinearity refers to linear associations between two or more variables in a multiple regression model. When collinear variables are fitted together in a model, the resulting model is unstable (because we are trying to estimate two parameters when one will do) and, we obtain inflated standard errors for these estimates. We have methods to detect this however. 15.2.1 Variance inflation factors Collinearity can be detected using variance inflation factors (VIFs). These are based on fitting linear models between each covariate (in turn) and the remaining covariates and assessing the predictive power of each: \\[\\begin{equation} VIF_p=\\frac{1}{1-R_p^2} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(R^2_p\\) is the squared correlation between the \\(p\\)-th observed covariate value and those predicted by a linear model containing the other covariates. If any of the \\(R^2_p\\) values are high, then the VIF will also be high. There are no firm rules about how large VIFs need to be before remedial action (e.g. removing a covariate) is required; some say VIFs \\(&gt; 5\\), some say VIFs \\(&gt;10\\). VIFs require adjustment if we estimate multiple parameters (i.e. regression coefficients) for a particular covariate, for example, the number of regression coefficients estimated for a factor is the number of levels - 1. However, VIFs are easily calculated using software. 15.2.1.1 Doing this in R We consider a regression of total height on left leg length (LLL) and right leg length (RLL) (seen in Chapter 14). The covariates LLL and RLL are strongly correlated but the variable length of hair (LOH) is not correlated with left leg length (see below) or indeed total height. Figure 15.1: Relationship between length of hair and left leg length. A function to obtain VIFs is available in the car package. To calculate the VIFs, we need to first fit a linear model with all the potential explanatory variables included. # Fit multiple regression model modelAll &lt;- lm(TotalHeight ~ LLL + RLL + LOH) # Load package require(car) # Calculate VIFs vif(modelAll) LLL RLL LOH 5636.487167 5637.364338 1.014372 The large values of the VIFs for LLL and RLL indicate that they are (not surprisingly) highly correlated. This suggests removal of one of the leg length variables. The variable RLL is removed from the model and the process is repeated. The resulting VIFs indicate that the remaining variables are not collinear. # Fit multiple regression model model2vars &lt;- lm(TotalHeight ~ LLL + LOH) # Calculate VIFs vif(model2vars) LLL LOH 1.011245 1.011245 NOTE: Variables should be removed one at a time and everything retested. 15.2.1.2 Dealing with collinearity Collinearity can be addressed by removing one of the collinear variables, but alternative methods exist if it desirable to retain the full set of covariates. The removal of one, or more, collinear covariates may occur automatically if \\(p\\)-values (see below) are used to drop terms from a model. This occurs since collinear terms are often unstable and thus highly uncertain, which means the associated \\(p\\)-values are often large. A 5 minute clip about this issue can be found here. A large \\(p\\)-value could mean either the variable has no effect, or is correlated with another predictor. Alternatively, the analyst may use their judgement in which collinear covariate(s) are retained and which are omitted (but readers might be skeptical of such a subjective approach). This can be done, for instance, by comparing the relative predictive power of the model with and without each covariate and choosing the covariate which predicts the response `best. Q15.1 Does a low VIF indicate that a variable should be in the final model? 15.3 \\(p\\)-value based model selection: the \\(F\\) test Collinearity identifies correlated predictor variables, it does not necessarily generate a good model. The \\(p\\)-value associated with an estimated regression coefficient can be used to decide whether to include a particular variable in the final model. Essentially, we perform a hypothesis test where the null hypothesis is that the regression coefficient is equal to zero; a regression coefficient equal to zero would have the effect of eliminating that variable from the model. The \\(p\\)-value associated with a relevant test statistic is then interpreted in the usual way. For covariates with one associated coefficient, retention can be based on the value of the associated \\(p\\)-value (i.e. large \\(p\\)-values suggest omission, small \\(p\\)-values (e.g. \\(&lt;\\) 0.05) suggest retention). For variables with multiple coefficients (e.g. factors) we are interested in assessing a group of coefficients simultaneously. In chapter 14, a model was fitted which included month as a factor variable; it had four levels and so there were three regression coefficients associated with it - these were denoted in the model as \\(\\beta_5\\), \\(\\beta_6\\), \\(\\beta_7\\). The test of interest is: \\[\\begin{align*} H_0:~&amp; \\beta_5=\\beta_{6}=\\beta_{7}=0\\\\ H_1:~&amp; \\textrm{ at least one of } \\beta_5,\\beta_{6},\\beta_{7} \\neq 0 \\end{align*}\\] We look at an example of this now. 15.3.0.1 Comparing models with and without a factor In fitting a linear model to the EIA data, Month was treated as a factor variable with four levels, therefore, models with and without Month differ by 3 parameters. We wish to compare a reduced model (without month) with the full model (with month) using a significance test. The idea is as follows: If month is an important predictor then a model with month should predict the response values considerably better than a model without month. If a model with and without month are equivalent then models with and without month will predict the response data similarly. We can use an \\(F\\) test to formally test the hypothesis that the model without month (with \\(q\\) parameters) is as good as the model with month (with \\(P\\) parameters) and hence the smaller model is preferred (and month is not required).

This test provides a large \\(F\\) test statistic (21.2102) and small associated \\(p\\)-value (\\(p&lt;0.0001\\)) for Month, which suggests a model with Month is significantly better than a model without Month. This indicates genuine month to month differences in average density and thus month information should be retained in the model. Differences in average density across phases Phase of construction was included as another factor variable in the model; this had three levels (denoted by A, B and C). If we re-order the model so Phase is last, we can consider whether Phase should be in the model.

Type I errors use the sequential sum of squares (which is affected by the order of the variables in the model specification) and are provided by the function anova. 15.4 Relative model fit While \\(F\\) tests (and associated \\(p\\)-values) can be used to compare nested models (when one model is a special case of the other) they cannot be used to compare models which are not nested. In contrast, both nested and non-nested models can be compared using `information-based fit criteria such as the AIC or BIC statistic. 15.4.1 Akaikes Information Criterion (AIC) Occams Razor is the very useful rule that when comparing models of equal explanatory power (i.e. models have the same \\(R^2\\)), that one should choose the simplest (i.e. fewest parameters). But what if the models have different levels of complexity along with different levels of explanatory power? Is a simple model of low explanatory power better than a complicated model with high explanatory power? The AIC statistic is a fit measure which is penalized for the number of parameters estimated in a model; a smaller AIC value signals a better model. The AIC is calculated using: \\[\\textrm{AIC} = \\textrm{Fit to the data} + \\textrm{model complexity}\\] \\[\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:aic} AIC= -2 \\textrm{ log-likelihood value} + 2P \\end{equation}\\] Where Fit to the data is measured using the so-called `log-likelihood value calculated using the estimated parameters in the model, model complexity is measured by \\(2P\\) where \\(P\\) is the number of covariates used to fit the model. 15.4.1.1 AICc When the sample size is not a great deal larger than the number of parameters in the model, the small sample corrected AICc is a better measure than AIC: \\[\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:aicc} AICc=AIC+\\frac{2P(P+1)}{n-P-1} \\end{equation}\\] This value gets very close to the AIC score when sample size, \\(n\\), is much larger than \\(P\\). 15.4.1.2 BIC The BIC score differs from the AIC score by employing a penalty that changes with the sample size (\\(n\\)): \\[\\begin{equation} BIC=-2 \\textrm{log-likelihood value} + \\log(n)P \\end{equation}\\] As for the AIC and AICc, smaller values signal `better models. BIC is more conservative than AIC and will produce models with fewer variables. 15.5 Other methods of model selection Information criterion and \\(p\\)-values represent two approaches to model selection both based on likelihood. However there are other methods. Cross-validation is a method used both by statisticians and data scientists, where a model is fitted to a subset (the training set) of the available data and then tested (validated) against the remainder of the dataset, the validation set. There a variety of forms of cross-validation. 15.6 Automated variable selection The number of possible combinations soon increases as the number of explanatory variables increases. There are various procedures described below which can be used to select the best model. All of the procedures could be implemented manually (i.e. by fitting a model, obtaining a test statistic, fitting the next model, etc.) but this can be very time-consuming. Fortunately, there are R functions available which can be used to implement them. 15.6.1 Stepwise selection Stepwise selection is a commonly used automated method which adds and drops covariates (from some start point) one at a time until no change occurs in the selected model. Importance of variables can be measured in a number of ways; the AIC/AICc and BIC statistics are commonly used, alternatively \\(p\\)-values could be used. Selection proceeds either: forwards from a simple model by addition of covariates, or backwards from a complex model by dropping covariates. More elaborate algorithms are possible. In forward selection, one variable is added at a time and the AIC etc. is calculated. Then another variable is tried INSTEAD, until all the candidate variables have been tried. The model with the lowest AIC (if lower than the starting model) is selected. A new round of selection then begins with the remaining candidate models considered. Modelling proceeds until no further reduction in AIC is found. In backward selection, starting from a model with all potential variables, one variable is removed and the AIC etc. is calculated. Then another variable is removed INSTEAD, until all the candidate variables have been tried. The model with the lowest AIC (if lower than the existing start model) is selected. A new round then begins with the remaining candidate variables removed one at time then replaced as before. Modelling proceeds until no further reduction in AIC is found. These two methods will not necessarily select the same model because different combinations of variables are being included in the considered models. 15.6.2 All possible subsets selection Rather than rely on an algorithm to determine the order in which variables are picked and dropped from a model (which can affect which covariates are retained), we can compare fit scores for all possible models. For example, for a 4 covariate model we can compare the fit scores for: an intercept only model (1 model) all models containing one covariate (4 models) all models containing two covariates (6 models) all models containing three covariates (4 models) the full model with 4 covariates (1 model) However, this method becomes prohibitively time consuming when there are a lot of covariates. 15.6.2.1 Doing this in R One way to fit all possible models is to use the dredge function inside the MuMIn library. The default score for ranking models is the AICc (but this can easily be changed) and the output includes all possible models which are ordered by AICc. As an example, we return to a model fitted to the EIA data with six potential explanatory variables. The dredge function has been used; the R code is shown (but not executed because it generates a lot of output). The regression coefficients for models with the four lowest AICc scores are shown below. : require(MuMIn) options(na.action = &quot;na.fail&quot;) dredge(modelEIAall) Fixed term is &quot;(Intercept)&quot; Global model call: lm(formula = Density ~ XPos + YPos + DistCoast + Depth + Phase + as.factor(Month) + Depth, data = wfdata) --- Model selection table (Int) as.fct(Mnt) Dpt DsC Phs XPs YPs df logLik AICc delta weight 64 3286 + -0.4544 -0.3152 + 0.1175 -0.5549 11 -149489.8 299001.6 0.00 0.983 56 3288 + -0.4532 -0.3213 0.1185 -0.5553 9 -149495.9 299009.7 8.16 0.017 60 2702 + -0.5575 + 0.1009 -0.4567 10 -149500.1 299020.2 18.67 0.000 52 2692 + -0.5583 0.1016 -0.4552 8 -149506.6 299029.2 27.65 0.000 63 3260 -0.4524 -0.3117 + 0.1184 -0.5505 8 -149521.9 299059.7 58.16 0.000 55 3264 -0.4513 -0.3174 0.1193 -0.5513 6 -149525.7 299063.4 61.82 0.000 Models ranked by AICc(x) We observe: the best model (by AICc) is at the top, estimated regression coefficients are displayed for continuous variables and a + for factor variables; neither a coefficient or a + indicates the variable is excluded. For example, line 3 shows DistCoast omitted and line 5 shows Month omitted. delta is the difference in AICc between the best (top) model and the listed model, weight associated with fit score (described below). One thing to note is that records with any missing values need to be excluded before using dredge because models with different numbers of observations cannot be compared with information criteria.. 15.6.2.2 AIC weights It is always important to be sensible about the covariates considered for selection, but this method also allows model comparison using weights based on your chosen fit score (e.g. AIC/AICc/BIC). These weights are based on the relative size of the difference between the fit of each candidate model and the best model using your chosen fit score. For example, using the AIC, weights are given by: \\[\\begin{equation}\\label{AICWeights} w_i(AIC)=\\frac{\\exp\\{-\\frac{1}{2}\\Delta_i(AIC)\\}}{\\sum_{k=1}^K\\exp\\{-\\frac{1}{2}\\Delta_k(AIC)\\}} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(K\\) is the number of models considered and \\[ \\Delta_i(AIC)=AIC_{i}- \\textrm{minimum AIC} \\] These weights sum to one over all candidate models and can be calculated using your chosen fit score e.g. AIC, AICC or BIC statistics. 15.7 Example: model selection with the medical data We will now consider model selection in the medical data set. This data set has an interesting diversity of variable types. As a reminder, lets look a the data available in the TEON data set: head(meddata) gend age vitdresul vitdc vit.12 vitbc folate TEON teonpres 1 female 50 10.98 insufficiency 310.0 normal 19.17 Yes 1 2 female 39 13.46 insufficiency 238.0 normal 8.16 Yes 1 3 female 39 15.36 insufficiency 361.0 normal 5.55 Yes 1 4 male 28 11.32 low 113.4 low 4.58 Yes 1 5 male 17 5.88 defficiency 313.0 normal 3.18 Yes 1 7 male 26 12.21 insufficiency 986.0 high 16.41 Yes 1 Lets consider creating a linear model with some covariates of mixed types. Specifically, well look at folate , TEON (presence/absence of TEON), and gend (gender) to explain vitdresul (vitamin D level). The data is shown in Figure 15.2. Figure 15.2: Scatterplot showing the relationships between vitamin D level, folate, TEON and gender. 15.7.1 Model specification Fitting models with lm is straight-forward. We specify response, \\(y\\), as a function of several explanatory variables, \\(x\\) - here vitdresul is a function of gend, TEON, (both categorical) and folate (numeric). Note, we may have causality the wrong way around here as TEON may be a consequence of vitamin deficiency (but this model serves to illustrate the methods). multiReg_lm &lt;- lm(vitdresul ~ TEON + gend + folate, data=meddata) We request a summary, as for other lm summary(multiReg_lm) Call: lm(formula = vitdresul ~ TEON + gend + folate, data = meddata) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -10.3112 -3.4375 -0.5539 1.6053 20.0017 Coefficients: Estimate Std.

Note TEON = no and Gender = Female are not listed in the estimates - this is the baseline (Table 15.1). Table 15.1: Construction of the fitted equations for all combinations of factor levels. TEON Gender Fitted model No Female \\(\\widehat{\\textrm{vitdresul}} = 18.278 + 0.119\\textrm{folate}\\) Yes Female \\(\\widehat{\\textrm{vitdresul}} = 18.278 -8.952 + 0.119\\textrm{folate}\\) No Male \\(\\widehat{\\textrm{vitdresul}} = 18.278 -0.104 + 0.119\\textrm{folate}\\) Yes Male \\(\\widehat{\\textrm{vitdresul}} = 18.278 -8.952 -0.104 + 0.119\\textrm{folate}\\) The intercept is 18.27: this is the estimated mean of vitdresul when TEON = no gender = female and folate = 0 Further, this is significantly different from zero (\\(p\\)-value is \\(&lt;2\\times 10^{-16}\\) - effectively zero). The TEONYes parameter is -8.95: this is the difference from the intercept, moving from TEON = No to TEON = yes it is a decrease of 8.95 units which is statistically significant (\\(p\\)-value = \\(2\\times 10^{-7}\\)). The gendmale parameter is -0.104: this is the difference from the intercept, moving from gender = Female to gender = Male it is a decrease of 0.104 units but is not statistically significant (\\(p\\)-value = 0.949). The coefficient for folate is 0.119: this is the mean increase in vitdresul for a unit increase in folate the increase is 0.119 units; not statistically significant (\\(p\\)-value = 0.217). It is easy to get 95% CIs for the parameter estimates: confint(multiReg_lm) 2.5 % 97.5 % (Intercept) 15.35283815 21.2024493 TEONYes -12.03035966 -5.8745290 gendmale -3.31998297 3.1122594 folate -0.07208286 0.3101002 Consistent with the tests previously (because were using 0.05 as the p-value cutoff): zero is not a plausible value for the intercept, or for the TEON relationship zero is a plausible value for the folate and gender effects. Possibly we could remove some variables from the model. 15.7.3 What should be in the model? Well now look to select components from/for our model using the methods described previously: Selection by p-values Selection by AIC and similar measures Automated selection - forwards, backwards and all-possible-subsets First, lets try including all variables that are available in the medical data set to explain vitdresul.

What has happened? Specifying y ~ . should put everything in the data set as a covariate (except the response, obviously). The reason is that we effectively have two (same) covariates indicating the presence/absence of TEON - TEON and teonpres. This is like having perfectly collinear variables and we cannot estimate both. This is one possible source of errors saying singular somewhere in the error. Lets try again, being a bit more conservative in the variables which are included: bigReg &lt;- lm(vitdresul ~ gend + age + vitdc + vit.12 + vitbc + folate + TEON, data=meddata, na.action = na.fail) summary(bigReg) Call: lm(formula = vitdresul ~ gend + age + vitdc + vit.12 + vitbc + folate + TEON, data = meddata, na.action = na.fail) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -6.604 -2.603 0.000 1.869 10.845 Coefficients: Estimate Std.

Small perturbations in the data (or indeed another sample) can produce a wildly different model structure although the predictions themselves might be quite similar. Note that implicit in this chapter, is that we want a model for prediction or understanding. In contrast, it may be the whole purpose of the model is to test a particular hypothesis. In this case, model reduction may not be necessary. What needs to be obtained is the probability associated with particular variable of interest as its significance is what is reported. However, we still may want to eliminate extraneous variables to make that particular test as efficient as possible. 15.8.1 Learning objectives At the end of this chapter you should understand: why model selection can be important, and how model selection is undertaken. 15.9 Answers Q15.1 A low VIF does not indicate a variable should be in the model, merely that it is not correlated with another predictor. Its inclusion in the model should still be tested. Q15.2 \\[ height=\\ {\\beta{}}_0+\\ {\\beta{}}_1LLL+\\ {\\beta{}}_2RLL+\\ {\\beta{}}_3finger+\\ {\\beta{}}_4Sex+\\ \\epsilon{} \\] Q15.3 The hypotheses are: \\(H_{0}\\): \\({\\beta{}}_p=0\\) (i.e. no relationship between explanatory variable \\(p\\) and the response variable, height) and \\(H_{1}\\): \\({\\beta{}}_p\\not=0\\) (i.e. there is a relationship between variable \\(p\\) and the response and hence, variable is a useful explanatory variable) Q15.4 No! All probabilities (Pr(&gt;|t|)) are greater than 0.05. Q15.5 The VIF scores (and common sense) imply that LLL and RLL are collinear and this correlation leads to a failure to detect a significant leg length effect. Therefore, one of the leg lengths should be removed from the model. Q15.6 Plotting the explanatory variables against each other would indicate the relationships between them. The pairs function is a useful function for doing this. Q15.7 The better fitting models are the ones with the lowest AIC. Therefore, reject finger as an explanatory variable because the model without finger (i.e. model2c) has the lowest AIC; refit the models using the reduced set of explanatory variables, check the AIC values for the new models.

Black women sometimes experience discrimination in ways similar to white womens experiences; sometimes they share very similar experiences with Black men. Yet often they experience double-discrimination-the combined effects of practices which discriminate on the basis of race, and on the basis of sex. And sometimes, they experience discrimination as Black women-not the sum of race and sex discrimination, but as Black women. Kimberlé Crenshaw (1989) 16.1 Introduction So far, we have only considered linear models that include main effects; so in the following model, \\[y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + \\epsilon\\] where \\(y\\) is the response, \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) are continuous variable main effects; \\(\\beta_0\\) is the intercept, \\(\\beta_1\\) and \\(\\beta_2\\) are the gradients associated with \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\), respectively, and \\(\\epsilon\\) is the error. Alternatively, we might have a categorical and continuous variable as main effects: \\[y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_{1_j} + \\beta_2 x_2 + \\epsilon\\] where \\(\\beta_{1j}\\) represents the intercept associated with a categorical variable level \\(j\\) (note, \\(\\beta_{1_1}=0\\) if level 1 is used as a baseline/reference level). However, we might also be interested in including interactions between variables. One question that might be asked of the environmental impact assessment (EIA) data, for example, is whether there is any evidence for a spatial re-distribution of bird density across construction phases (A,B or C) of the wind farm. We can do this by asking if a particular sort of density pattern in the X or Y spatial direction differs across phases, i.e. does the effect on density of X or Y differ between the levels of phase. We call this sort of effect an interaction. Interaction is equivalent to the idea of synergy in chemistry or intersectionality in the humanities, or social sciences (see the quote by Kimberlé Crenshaw at the beginning of the chapter). Example Say Drug A raised heartbeat by say 10 beats a minute and Drug B raises heartbeat by 20 beats per minute. Taken together they do not increase heartbeat by 30 beats per minute but reduce it by 10. There is a non-additive effect. But what does an interaction mean in statistical terms? In this chapter we illustrate statistical interaction and how to include them in linear models. 16.1.1 Fitting different models Lets investigate human height as a function of leg length. The data contains measurements for 100 males and 100 females, where the two groups differ in height (Figure 16.1). We see that height differs by sex, but how is that affected by leg length? Figure 16.1: Boxplot of height by sex. Exploratory analysis suggests that whilst females are generally shorter, the relationship between leg length and total height is the same in both sexes (Figure 16.2). There is a difference in the intercept but not in the gradient (slope) between the two sexes. Figure 16.2: Scatterplot of left leg length and total height by sex. This is confirmed by the regression analysis. # Fit model model_height1 &lt;- lm(TotalHeight ~ Sex + LLL, data=heightdata) # ANOVA anova(model_height1) Analysis of Variance Table Response: TotalHeight Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F) Sex 1 5110.8 5110.8 341.36 &lt; 2.2e-16 *** LLL 1 6646.5 6646.5 443.93 &lt; 2.2e-16 *** Residuals 197 2949.5 15.0 --- Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 # Summary summary (model_height1) Call: lm(formula = TotalHeight ~ Sex + LLL, data = heightdata) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -12.6939 -2.3477 -0.1715 2.6812 9.8925 Coefficients: Estimate Std.

Has this achieved what we want? We have not really allowed the model to consider the possibility that the relationship between LLL and total height differs between the sexes. We look at this now. 16.2 Fitting interaction terms To test whether the relationship is different between the sexes we could fit regression lines to each sex independently and then examine the gradient terms in each model. However, this would halve our sample size in each case. An alternative is to allow the sex of the measured human to influence both intercept and the gradient of the best fit lines. Using Sex as a main effect allows for a different intercept (we have done this already). For an additional influence on gradient we need to specify an interaction term. We can do this in R by using the term : in the model formula between the variables of interest e.g. # Fit model with interaction model_height_interaction &lt;- lm(TotalHeight ~ LLL + Sex + LLL:Sex, data=heightdata) summary(model_height_interaction) Call: lm(formula = TotalHeight ~ LLL + Sex + LLL:Sex, data = heightdata) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -12.7063 -2.4203 -0.0151 2.6133 9.3352 Coefficients: Estimate Std.

Two things to note: the intercepts are NOT the same for each sex because the \\(y\\) axis is not at \\(x = 0\\). we have considered an interaction of a categorical variable with a continuous variable (= effect on the gradient). 16.2.1 Specifying interactions in model formulae If we were to write the above model as a general equation it would be: \\[\\mathrm{TotalHeight} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_{\\textrm{Sex}_j} + \\beta_2\\mathrm{LLL} + \\gamma_{\\textrm{Sex}_j}\\mathrm{LLL} + \\epsilon \\] or \\[\\mathrm{TotalHeight} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_{\\textrm{Sex}_j} + (\\beta_2 + \\gamma_{\\textrm{Sex}_j})\\mathrm{LLL} + \\epsilon \\] where \\(\\beta_0\\) is the intercept, \\(\\beta_{\\textrm{Sex}_j}\\) is the intercept coefficient associated with Sex category \\(j\\) (i.e. Male or Female), \\(\\beta_2\\) is the gradient coefficient associated with \\(LLL\\), \\(\\gamma_{\\textrm{Sex}_j}\\) is the gradient coefficient associated with Sex category \\(j\\) for \\(LLL\\), and \\(\\epsilon\\) is the error term. In this example, \\(\\beta_{\\textrm{Sex}_\\textrm{Female}}=0\\) and \\(\\gamma_{\\textrm{Sex}_\\textrm{Female}}=0\\) because Female is the baseline or reference level. Writing this type of equation in even more general notation (e.g. with \\(y\\) and \\(x\\)), then we have: \\[y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_{1_j} + \\beta_2 x_2 + \\gamma_{1_j}x_2 + \\epsilon\\] \\[y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_{1_j} + (\\beta_2 + \\gamma_{1_j})x_2 + \\epsilon\\] where \\(\\beta_0\\) is the intercept, \\(\\beta_{1j}\\) in the intercept coefficient associated with categorical variable 1 level \\(j\\), \\(\\beta_2\\) is gradient associated with continuous variable \\(x_2\\), \\(\\gamma_{1j}\\) is the gradient associated with categorical variable 1 level \\(j\\) and \\(x_2\\), and \\(\\epsilon\\) is the error term. An interaction of a continuous variable with another continuous variable would affect the gradient too, but in 3 dimensions (i.e. that interaction would have to be visualized using 3D plots or similar, e.g. section 3.6.4 and 3.6.5). Algebraically, an interaction between two continuous variables (\\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\)) is (simply) given as: \\[y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + \\beta_3 x_1x_2 + \\epsilon\\] An interaction of two categorical variables would affect the intercepts and be illustrated (assuming no other variables) by a 3D bar chart or similar. Algebraically, an interaction between two categorical variables (denoted by \\(1\\) and \\(2\\)) is given as: \\[y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_{1_j} + \\beta_{2_k} + \\gamma_{12_{jk}} + \\epsilon\\] where \\(\\beta_1\\) and \\(\\beta_2\\) are the intercepts associated with categorical variables \\(1\\) and \\(2\\), level \\(j\\) and \\(k\\), respectively. \\(\\gamma_{12_{jk}}\\) is the intercept associated with the interaction between categorical variables 1 and 2, level \\(j\\) and \\(k\\). We can actually also have interactions of 3, or more, variables but the interpretation of such models can be very difficult and the data need to be well supported (i.e. you need cases of all the different combinations of the variable levels in the factorial case). 16.3 Interactions in practise In this section, we return to two data sets that we have introduced in previous chapters and look at including interactions. Example We can implement an interaction(s) in our model to explain density by including phase:X and phase:Y terms: Call: lm(formula = Density ~ XPos + YPos + DistCoast + Depth + as.factor(Month) + Phase + XPos:Phase + YPos:Phase, data = wfdata) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -12.27 -5.28 -2.96 -0.16 1715.13 Coefficients: Estimate Std.

In the example above, the model includes Phase, XPos and YPos as main effects. If the interaction is significant, the \\(p\\)-values associated with the main effects are irrelevant and so the main effects are retained. If \\(p\\)-value selection is in operation and the interaction is removed, the main effects should not be removed before re-evaluating the model. Interactions always come last in the sequence of predictors. A phase-based interaction term In our new interaction-based model (above) we have: \\[\\begin{equation} y_{it}=\\beta_{0}+\\beta_1x_{1i}+\\beta_2x_{2i}+\\beta_3x_{3i}+...+\\beta_{13}x_{13i} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\beta_{1}-\\beta_9\\) and \\(x_{1i}-x_{9i}\\) are as described before and relate to XPos, YPos, DistCoast, Depth, Month and Phase. The new aspects of the output are as follows: XPos:phaseB: \\(\\beta_{10}\\) is the expected change in the slope coefficient for the XPos relationship in phase B compared with the XPos relationship in phase A XPos:phaseC: \\(\\beta_{11}\\) is the expected change in the slope coefficient for the XPos relationship in phase C compared with the XPos relationship in phase A YPos:phaseB: \\(\\beta_{12}\\) is the expected change in the slope coefficient for the YPos relationship in phase B compared with the YPos relationship in phase A YPos:phaseC: \\(\\beta_{13}\\) is the expected change in the slope coefficient for the YPos relationship in phase C compared with the YPos relationship in phase A The uncertainty associated with the interaction-based estimates result in: no statistically significant difference between the XPos-slope coefficient for phase A compared with phase C (XPos:phaseC; \\(p\\)-value=0.840) no statistically significant difference between the YPos-slope coefficient for phase B compared with phase A (YPos:phaseB; \\(p\\)-value=0.636). no statistically significant difference between the YPos-slope coefficient for phase C compared with phase A (YPos:phaseC; \\(p\\)-value=0.588). Looking at the ANOVA table below, (overall) there is evidence for a XPos-phase interaction (\\(p\\)-value=0.011) but no evidence for a YPos-phase interaction term (\\(p\\)-value=0.630).

Note, while the Phase term considered alone is not significant in the model, it forms part of the interaction term and so is typically retained in the model regardless. There are not grounds to reduce this model further, if backwards selection was being undertaken. 16.3.1 Medical data A previous model considered the influence of TEON, folate and gender on vitamin D level separately. But what if we believed folate potentially affected vitamin D level but in a different way depending on gender? This can be investigated using an interaction term: multiReg_lm &lt;- lm(vitdresul ~ TEON + folate + gend + folate:gend, data=meddata) summary(multiReg_lm) Call: lm(formula = vitdresul ~ TEON + folate + gend + folate:gend, data = meddata) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -10.3182 -3.5757 -0.7231 1.8166 20.1076 Coefficients: Estimate Std.

But the second to last term is also the same, which may come as a surprise. Anova has to follow the principle of marginality, the interaction must come last. The main effects are now given as if they were second from last. Thus gend remained the same (it was second from last before) but the \\(p\\)-value associated with TEON and folate are different. Notice the Anova table is subtitled Type II tests. Remember ordinary anova is Type I, the sum of squares are considered sequentially. Type II sums of squares are sum of squares where the term is considered as if it was last in the model. 16.4 Model selection and interactions If backwards model selection is being undertaken, interaction terms should be considered first for removal (following the principle of marginality) and then other main effects not associated with the interaction as before. Main effects associated with the interaction should not be considered (for rejection) unless the interaction is rejected. If forwards selection is being undertaken, main effects should be added first and then interactions added. 16.4.1 Backwards selection in the EIA data set Backwards selection is illustrated using different selection criterion for the following model. modelcomplex &lt;- lm(Density ~ XPos + YPos + DistCoast + Depth + as.factor(Month) + Phase + XPos:Phase + YPos:Phase, data=wfdata) 16.4.1.1 Using \\(p\\)-values Using Anova (Type II sum of squares) we can simultaneously consider both interactions at the same time (as we saw above).

Hence, the best fit model using \\(p\\)-values is: Density ~ XPos + YPos + DistCoast + Depth + as.factor(Month) + Phase + XPos:Phase. 16.4.1.2 Using AIC To illustrate model selection with AIC, we start again with the full model above (i.e. including two interaction terms) and consider the AIC of this model and the AICs of the model without the XPos:Phase term and the model without the YPos:Phase term. AIC(lm(Density ~ XPos + YPos + DistCoast + Depth + as.factor(Month) + Phase + XPos:Phase + YPos:Phase, data=wfdata)) [1] 298998.8 AIC(lm(Density ~ XPos + YPos + DistCoast + Depth + as.factor(Month) + Phase + XPos:Phase, data=wfdata)) [1] 298995.7 AIC(lm(Density ~ XPos + YPos + DistCoast + Depth + as.factor(Month) + Phase + YPos:Phase, data=wfdata)) [1] 299003.9 The AICs are 298998.8, 298995.7 and 299003.9, respectively; the smallest AIC is for the model without the the YPos:Phase term (perhaps not surprisingly given the model chosen using \\(p\\)-values). We now use this model and consider how removing the other covariates (e.g. DistCoast, Depth and Month) affect the AIC. # remove DistCoast AIC (lm(Density ~ XPos + YPos + Depth + as.factor(Month) + XPos:Phase + YPos:Phase, data=wfdata)) [1] 299014.4 # remove Depth AIC (lm(Density ~ XPos + YPos + DistCoast + as.factor(Month) + XPos:Phase + YPos:Phase, data=wfdata)) [1] 299117.4 # remove Month AIC (lm(Density ~ XPos + YPos + DistCoast + Depth + XPos:Phase + YPos:Phase, data=wfdata)) [1] 299053.6 The AICs are 299014.4, 299117.4 and 299053.6, so we have no grounds to reduce the model further. So our best model using AIC is: Density ~ XPos + YPos + DistCoast + Depth + as.factor(Month) + Phase + XPos:Phase. One thing to note: \\(p\\)-value model selection and AIC (or similar score) selection do not necessarily produce the same answers! 16.4.2 Backwards selection in the medical data set Lets see what happens with the medical data set. 16.4.2.1 Using \\(p\\)-values In this case, the model called multiReg_lm indicated the folate:gend term was associated with a \\(p\\)-value&gt;0.05, so we remove this term and then consider the \\(p\\)-values associated with all of the main effects. Again, the quickest way to do this is to use Anova rather than consider lots of sequential models using anova. multiReg_lm &lt;- lm(vitdresul ~ TEON + folate + gend, data=meddata) Anova(multiReg_lm) Anova Table (Type II tests) Response: vitdresul Sum Sq Df F value Pr(&gt;F) TEON 961.51 1 33.9497 2.905e-07 *** folate 44.08 1 1.5565 0.2174 gend 0.12 1 0.0042 0.9486 Residuals 1586.01 56 --- Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 The term gend has the highest \\(p\\)-value &gt;0.05, so we reject that term and go again. multiReg_lm &lt;- lm(vitdresul ~ TEON + folate, data=meddata) Anova(multiReg_lm) Anova Table (Type II tests) Response: vitdresul Sum Sq Df F value Pr(&gt;F) TEON 1099.38 1 39.5079 4.879e-08 *** folate 47.64 1 1.7119 0.196 Residuals 1586.12 57 --- Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 Now we have grounds for rejecting folate and we are left with a model with TEON only. multiReg_lm &lt;- lm(vitdresul ~ TEON, data=meddata) Anova(multiReg_lm) Anova Table (Type II tests) Response: vitdresul Sum Sq Df F value Pr(&gt;F) TEON 1078.5 1 38.289 6.666e-08 *** Residuals 1633.8 58 --- Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 summary(multiReg_lm) Call: lm(formula = vitdresul ~ TEON, data = meddata) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -10.1262 -3.7462 -0.2462 2.4929 20.3938 Coefficients: Estimate Std.

We should now compare the model without TEON but with the interaction. AIC(lm(vitdresul ~ folate + gend + folate:gend, data=meddata)) [1] 403.8906 This AIC is not lower than 376.2377, so we stay with the model: vitdresul ~ TEON + folate + gend + folate:gend model. Note that this is a different model to that chosen using P-values. Q16.1 Dr Teuthis was interested in predicting entire length (EL) of a giant squid from mantle length (ML). Mantle length is the length of just the body, or mantle, and the entire length is the length of the body plus head plus tentacles. See Paxton(2016) for an actual analysis of the data. Dr Teuthis was also interested in whether the ratio of total length to mantle length is different by sex (Male, Female or Not Known, NK). The following analysis was performed. modelMLtoEL &lt;- lm(EL ~ ML + Sex + ML:Sex, data=squidtemp) Write down the general equation for the model using \\(\\beta\\)s.

Q16.3 It might be illustrated using a scatterplot with mantle length on the x-axis and entire length on the y-axis with the points different colours, or symbols, to represent the different sex categories. Three best-fit regression lines are estimated (for Males, Females and NK) and superimposed on to the plot, representing the relationship between EL and ML for each sex. Q16.4 This model contains an interaction term and so the interaction term should be considered first (because of the principle of marginality) before individual terms in the interaction can be excluded as main effect terms. In this case, the interaction should be excluded because it is not significant (\\(p\\)-value=0.44). Note, if an interaction was not included in the model, then remove the variable with the highest probability if it is greater than the significance level used for testing (i.e. if the term is not significant). Q16.5 Female is used as the reference level.

That is, the model is used to predict, or estimate, values of the response \\(y\\) given values of the explanatory variables \\(x\\). This could involve interpolation (e.g. estimating \\(y\\) within the known range of \\(x\\)) or extrapolation (e.g. estimating \\(y\\) outwith the known range of \\(x\\), or combination of \\(x\\)s in multiple regression). As well as estimating a particular value (point estimate), we also need to provide a measure of uncertainty of the estimate and this will depend on the aim of the prediction. In this chapter, we illustrate how to obtain a predicted value and the associated uncertainty. 17.2 Prediction Imagine a regression of height (explanatory variable) and IQ (response) amongst a sample of humans (Figure 17.1). These data are stored in a dataframe df1 and a simple linear regression model has been fitted (a summary is given below): Figure 17.1: Scatterplot of Height (m) and IQ and fitted regression line. # Fit model modelIQ &lt;- lm(IQ ~ Height, data=df1) # Summary summary(modelIQ) Call: lm(formula = IQ ~ Height, data = df1) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -0.41039 -0.08653 -0.01571 0.09717 0.38772 Coefficients: Estimate Std.

Figure 17.2: Scatterplot of Height (m) and IQ with a predicted value (black cross). 17.2.1 Doing this in R We can (moderately) easily do the prediction in R by creating a new data frame containing the values we want predictions for and then use the predict function: # Specify value for height Height &lt;- 1.72 # Create data frame df2 &lt;- data.frame(Height) # Prediction using specified linear model object predict(modelIQ, newdata=df2) 1 107.1563 Note that the name of the explanatory variable we wish to predict over in df2 (i.e. Height) has to match the name of the explanatory variable in the model object modelIQ. 17.3 Uncertainty in the prediction As you have seen, getting a predicted value (point estimate) is simply a matter of substituting in for the relevant predictor variables, but it is also essential to obtain a measure of uncertainty. As usual, a standard error is required for the predicted value (denoted by \\(\\hat y_p\\)): \\[se(\\hat{y}_p)=\\sqrt{MSE\\times (\\frac{1}{n}+\\frac{(x_p-\\bar{x})^2}{\\sum{(x_i-\\bar{x})^2}}})\\] where \\(MSE\\) is the mean square error, or the residual, which can be obtained from the ANOVA table or the square of the residual standard error given by summary \\(n\\) is the number of observations \\(x_p\\) is the \\(x\\) value you want to predict on, \\(i = 1, ..., n\\) \\(\\bar x\\) is the mean value of \\(x\\) Then the confidence interval can be obtained as you have seen before: \\[\\hat y_p \\pm t_{(\\alpha/2, df)}\\times se(\\hat{y}_p)\\] where the \\(t\\) multiplier is found from the t distribution which has the relevant error degrees of freedom associated with the model. We can now construct a 99% confidence interval for the mean response using the following components: The mean square error is the square of the residual standard error, hence, \\(MSE = 0.1586^2 = 0.0252\\). The \\(MSE\\) is also provided in the ANOVA table. Number of observations, \\(n=100\\) Mean height is \\(\\bar{\\mathrm{Height}}=1.676458\\) mean(df1$Height) [1] 1.676458 The sum of the difference between each value and the mean is given by \\[\\sum{(\\mathrm{Height}_i-\\bar{\\mathrm{Height}})^2} \\] sum((df1$Height - mean(df1$Height))^2) [1] 0.04125725 Hence, the standard error is \\[se(\\hat{IQ})=\\sqrt{0.0252\\times (\\frac{1}{100}+\\frac{(1.72-1.676)^2}{0.041})} =0.038\\] To obtain the confidence interval, we also need the relevant quantile for the 99% confidence interval. This is obtained from the \\(t\\) distribution where the degrees of freedom are associated with the error (residuals) term, i.e. \\(df=98\\). # Want quantile with 0.5% in each tail qt(p=0.005, df=98) [1] -2.626931 Therefore, the CI is given by: \\[107.156 \\pm -2.63\\times 0.038\\] Lower bound: 107.058; Upper bound: 107.254 Thus, for a height of 1.72m, the predicted IQ is 107.156 (99% CI 107.01 - 107.25). In other words 99 out of 100 times a regression line was fitted to random data from this population the estimated mean IQ for a height of 1.72m would lie in the range 107.01 - 107.25. 17.3.1 Doing this in R As usual this can be done simply in R, by adding the interval argument to the predict function. # Prediction with CI predict(modelIQ, newdata=df2, se.fit=TRUE, interval=&quot;confidence&quot;, level=0.99) $fit fit lwr upr 1 107.1563 107.0578 107.2549 $se.fit [1] 0.03751133 $df [1] 98 $residual.scale [1] 0.1585812 The residual scale here is, confusingly, the square of the mean square error. 17.3.2 Confidence intervals for the line We can estimate the confidence interval for the whole line by supplying a range of predictor values to predict over: # Obtain a sequence of Heights from min to max Height &lt;- seq(from=min(df1$Height), to=max(df1$Height), by=0.001) Height[1:5] [1] 1.630961 1.631961 1.632961 1.633961 1.634961 # Create dataframe df3 &lt;- data.frame(Height) # Prediction with CI bounds.ci &lt;- predict(modelIQ, newdata=df3, se.fit=T, interval=&quot;confidence&quot;, level=0.99) # Plot data plot (df1$Height, df1$IQ, xlab=&quot;Height&quot;, ylab=&quot;IQ&quot;) # Add regression line abline (modelIQ) # Add CI lines (df3$Height, bounds.ci$fit[,3], lty=2) lines (df3$Height, bounds.ci$fit[,2], lty=2) Figure 17.3: Scatterplot of Height and IQ with confidence interval This confidence interval (Figure 17.3) on the mean response is narrowest around mean value for Height (i.e. 1.676m) and the mean value of IQ (i.e. 106.8), \\(pt(\\bar{\\mathrm{Height}},\\bar{IQ})\\). It is the confidence interval for the mean response, i.e. the overall uncertainty in the fit in the line. 17.3.3 Prediction intervals Sometimes we are interested in the uncertainty in the individual predictions i.e. what range of values would we find in IQ for a man of height 1.72m. Not the mean response but the range of individual values that might plausibly be found. This is called a prediction interval as opposed to the confidence interval and is calculated as before, except with a slightly different estimate of standard error: \\[\\textrm{prediction }se(\\hat{y})=\\sqrt{MSE\\times (1+\\frac{1}{n}+\\frac{(x_p-\\bar{x})^2}{\\sum{(x_i-\\bar{x})^2}})}\\] The prediction standard error for an observation at 1.72m is: \\[\\textrm{prediction }se(\\hat{IQ})=\\sqrt{0.025\\times (1+ \\frac{1}{100}+\\frac{(1.72-1.676)^2}{0.041})} =0.163\\] Hence, the 99% prediction interval for the response at 1.72m is: \\[107.156 \\pm -2.63\\times 0.163\\] Lower bound: 106.728 Upper bound: 107.585 17.3.3.1 Doing this in R As before, we can use R to do things easily: # Prediction CI predict(modelIQ, newdata=df2, se.fit=TRUE, interval=&quot;prediction&quot;, level=0.99) $fit fit lwr upr 1 107.1563 106.7283 107.5844 $se.fit [1] 0.03751133 $df [1] 98 $residual.scale [1] 0.1585812 NB R still gives the confidence standard error. And as before we can also construct a prediction interval over the entire range of heights. However this does not reflect the uncertainty in the mean response but the uncertainty in individual responses. # Plot data plot (df1$Height, df1$IQ, xlab=&quot;Height&quot;, ylab=&quot;IQ&quot;, ylim=c(105.9,107.6)) # Add regression line abline (modelIQ) # Add confidence interval lines (Height, bounds.ci$fit[,3], lty=2) lines (Height, bounds.ci$fit[,2], lty=2) # Obtain prediction interval and add to plot bounds.pi &lt;- predict(modelIQ, newdata=df3, se.fit=TRUE, interval=&quot;prediction&quot;, level=0.99) lines (Height, bounds.pi$fit[,3], lty=3) lines (Height, bounds.pi$fit[,2], lty=3) Figure 17.4: Scatterplot of Height (m) and IQ with confidence (dashes) and prediction intervals (dots) around the best fit line (solid line). Notice that the prediction interval is much wider than the confidence interval (Figure 17.4): The confidence interval considers the uncertainty in the mean response, which essentially relates to the uncertainty in the estimated regression coefficients (i.e. \\(\\hat \\beta\\)s). The prediction interval considers the uncertainty in the individual prediction which includes the uncertainty in the estimated regression coefficients (i.e. \\(\\hat \\beta\\)s) plus the uncertainty in the prediction (i.e. the variance of the error). Example An interesting application of regression, using a slightly more complicated regression technique that allowed curved fits is shown in Figure (Figure 17.5). Of interest was the relationship of jaw size to body length in giant squid. If we know this, undigested squid jaws found in sperm whales can be used to predict the size of squid sperm whales feed on. Here the uncertainty in the actual individual squid was of interest and so prediction intervals were calculated as well as a confidence interval. The prediction interval for body length of the longest jaw actually found in a sperm whale is given by the vertical green line. The longest mantle length measured is given by the horizontal green line. Statistics suggests some giant squid grow rather large!! Although this is based on an extrapolation (Paxton 2016). Figure 17.5: Regression of mantle length of lower rostral length in squid. The black line is the best fit line 17.4 Prediction in multiple regression Prediction in multiple regression is carried out in the same way as in the simple regression case (although the calculation of the standard error is more complicated). In R, a data frame with all the relevant covariates (i.e. those used in the model) must be created. To illustrate prediction for a multiple regression model, we return to a model fitted to the EIA data: # Fit a linear model linearAll &lt;- lm(Density ~ XPos + YPos + DistCoast + Depth + as.factor(Month) + Phase, data=wfdata) # Specify values for prediction # Create dataframe df.wf &lt;- data.frame (XPos = mean (wfdata$XPos), YPos = mean (wfdata$YPos), DistCoast = 5, Depth = 10, Month = 4, Phase = &quot;C&quot;) # Prediction predict(linearAll, newdata=df.wf, se.fit=TRUE, interval=&quot;confidence&quot;, level=0.95) $fit fit lwr upr 1 3.568311 2.669927 4.466695 $se.fit [1] 0.45835 $df [1] 31492 $residual.scale [1] 27.84424 Hence, for the mean values of XPos and YPos, a DistCoast of 5km and Depth of 10m in Phase C in April, the predicted density of birds is 3.57 (95% 2.67-4.47) birds per km\\(^2\\). It is possible to predict for any combinations of covariates even those that did not occur in the data. For example, the Depth and DistCoast values used in the above prediction may not actually occur together for any record in the observed data. This is a form of extrapolation and is dangerous (and potentially even pointless - why extrapolate from combinations of variables that do not occur in nature?). Q17.1 For the following scenarios decide whether confidence intervals or prediction intervals would be more appropriate. a. Estimation of the rate of change of population size of a new pest species entering an exploited environment. b. Estimation of the heart rate in a clinical trial as a side effect of an experimental drug. c. Estimation of the spatial density of an animal population. d. Estimate of the relationship of IQ to height as part of a psychological investigation. 17.5 Summary Given a fitted equation, obtaining a point estimate from a linear model is straightforward although care should be taken if extrapolation is being undertaken beyond the range of the data. Estimation of the uncertainty is more complex and requires decisions about \\(\\alpha\\) and whether confidence or prediction intervals are required. 17.5.1 Learning objectives At the end of this chapter you should be able to: predict from a given fitted model understand when to use confidence or prediction intervals. 17.6 Answers Q17.1 Whether confidence intervals or prediction intervals are more appropriate is very contextual. Q17.1 a. Here the emphasis is on the rate of change estimated by the gradient of a regression. So here a confidence interval on the gradient would be most appropriate. Q17.1 b. In this case presumably safety is an issue so a plausible range of values for individuals is a primary concern so a prediction interval would be most appropriate. Q17.1 c. If the interest was conservation then perhaps a prediction interval would be more appropriate, as that relates to the actual numbers of individuals. This is seldom done in practice however. Q17.1 d. Here presumably the relationship is of more theoretical interest than practical policy so probably confidence intervals are relevant.

We have mentioned \\(R^2\\) in part, which measures the proportion of variability explained by the model, but there are other considerations as well. Also, if the assumptions are not met, then any conclusions from the analysis may not be valid. In this chapter, we look at the model assumptions and how to check they are valid with data. Fitting linear models is no problem - given a numeric response and some covariates,we can estimate parameters most of the time. Lots of different models may be possible and we want to select between them, or perhaps we have just one theoretical model we want to fit. How do we convince ourselves that the model is actually any good? Our linear models effectively consist of two parts - a mathematical description of the signal and another for the noise. We want to check these mathematical descriptions are reasonable given the data. We would have more confidence in our predictions, or descriptions, obtained from the model if these assumptions (based on the mathematical descriptions) are met. 18.2 Predictive power We have previously seen the \\(R^2\\) statistic: This can be calculated as the squared correlation between \\(y\\) and \\(\\hat{y}\\) i.e. agreement between what we observed, \\(y\\) and what the model predicts, \\(\\hat y\\). It can be interpreted as the proportion of variance explained by the model: \\[R^2 = 1-\\frac{\\sum_i (y_i-\\hat{y}_i)^2}{\\sum_i (y_i-\\bar{y})^2} =1 - \\frac{SS_{\\rm error}}{SS_{\\rm total}}\\] The \\(R^2\\) is frequently touted as a measure of the predictive power of the model. Take this with a grain of salt: An over-fitted model can have a great \\(R^2\\), but will predict poorly (you explain your particular sample well, but little else). A really good \\(R^2\\) might be suspicious - have you somehow effectively included the response on both sides of the equation? Nonetheless a good \\(R^2\\) is reassuring, but what is a good \\(R^2\\)? This is context specific - some things we model have inherently a very low signal-to-noise ratio. While \\(R^2\\) scores may be indicative of predictive power, low values do not mean your model is wrong. It is easy to see that data with high variance could return a low score (since the data will be highly variable), even if we have the correct model for our data. What is the \\(R^2\\) for models fitted to EIA data? Lets fit a couple of models to the EIA data - one without interactions (model1), the other with interactions (model2) and look at the summaries, in particular the Multiple R-squared value: # Specify month as a factor #wfdata$month &lt;- as.factor(wfdata$month) # Model without interactions model1 &lt;- lm(Density ~ XPos + YPos + DistCoast + Depth + Month + Phase, data=wfdata) # Model with XPos:Phase interaction model2 &lt;- lm(Density ~ XPos + YPos + DistCoast + Depth + Month + Phase + XPos:Phase, data=wfdata) # Summary summary(model1) Call: lm(formula = Density ~ XPos + YPos + DistCoast + Depth + Month + Phase, data = wfdata) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -10.63 -5.17 -3.22 -0.17 1716.61 Coefficients: Estimate Std.

(We would think \\(\\sim 20\\%\\) is pretty good!) A good \\(R^2\\) is context specific - it need not be large for the model to be good/useful. 18.2.1 Signal versus noise Recall - were breaking our observed data down into two broad components: signal (explained by a model) and noise (see below). The example below is a linear model - despite being wiggly. In more mathematical terms, the data can be described as a signal plus noise which in turn can be considered as: \\[{\\rm outcome} = {\\rm model} + \\rm{noise}\\] which we can think of as: \\[y=f({\\rm covariates}) + {\\rm noise}\\] where the model for the signal is all the bits we put in \\(f(.)\\). Things like \\[f(x) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + \\beta_3(x_1 \\times x_2) + ... \\beta_p x_s\\] The model for the noise captures all the bits left over after \\(f(\\textrm{covariates})\\) is subtracted from the response: \\[y - f(x) = {\\rm noise}\\] We model the noise using probability distributions (noise is supposed to be stochastic (random) after all). We will only use one distribution - the normal distribution but distributions are possible. Therefore, when we estimate and subtract the signal from the response, the stuff left over should look like (independent) draws from a single normal distribution. 18.3 Model assumptions The commonly quoted list of assumptions for linear models relate mainly to the noise. We assume the errors: are well described by a normal distribution, with a mean of zero. have constant variance (quantified by \\(\\sigma^2\\)) and are not related to the mean of the fitted values (or anything else), are independent of each other. We also assume our model for the signal is correct - but if it were not, this might be evidenced in the estimated errors. 18.3.1 Normality assumption We assume one normal distribution provides the (independent) noise. This is the same assumption we encountered earlier so once the signal has been subtracted from the response, differences should be indistinguishable from random draws from a normal distribution. A normal distribution has two parameters - mean and variance (or standard deviation). The mean should be zero and there is only one variance governing it, hence the constant variance assumption. The noise is the response with the model for the signal subtracted i.e. \\(y-\\hat{y}\\), the residuals. Therefore, to examine noise, we look at the distribution of the residuals. What do we expect to see? Once we remove \\(\\hat{y}\\) from our \\(y\\), the remains ought to look something like these shapes (variances, or spread, may vary) (Figure 18.1). Figure 18.1: Residuals plotted against explanatory variable X and show a broad band of scatter above and below the blue line. The histogram is the distribution of residuals and indicates that the mean is zero. 18.3.1.1 Assessing Normality There are two main approaches to assessing whether data are normally distributed: A somewhat, qualitative assessment from plotting either: a histogram of residuals, or a QQ-Norm plot of residuals A formal test of normality (there are several) e.g. Wilks-Shapiro test for normality Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for normality Histogram of residuals If we look at the residuals from model1 fitted to the EIA data (Figure 18.2), the residuals appear to be right skewed compared with what we would expect from a normal distribution. Figure 18.2: EIA model residuals compared to a normal distribution QQ-Norm plots QQ (Quantile-Quantile)-Norm plots: display the quantiles of two sets of data (in essence their distributions) against one another. If their shapes are similar, then you tend to get a straight line. For a QQ-Norm plot, a normal distribution is the reference distribution. If your data is roughly normally distributed, the QQ-Norm plot should be a straight(-ish) line. Note: small samples can be a bit wiggly, even if normally distributed. For our model1 the residuals are plotted in Figure 18.3 in comparison to actual normal residuals (right). Figure 18.3: Left. QQ-Norm plot of the residuals from model1., Right. QQ-Norm plot of normally distributed residuals. A QQ-Norm plot is created by sorting the residuals in order and plotting against the standardised quantiles for the distribution of interest for a given range of probabilities. Typically the \\(i\\)th point is given by: \\[p(i) = i/(n+1)\\] If \\(n\\) is 200 then the quantiles are 1/200, 2/201,3/201200/201. The quantiles from a normal distribution can be obtained by qnorm in R. The code to illustrate a QQ-Norm plot is shown below. In the EIA data, we have \\(n = 31502\\). # Sort residuals - smallest to largest sortedresiduals &lt;- sort(residuals(model1)) # Number of residuals print(length(sortedresiduals)) [1] 31502 # Obtain points pts &lt;- seq(1/31503, 31502/31503, by = 1/31503) # Obtain theoretical quantiles (using standard normal) stannorm &lt;- qnorm(pts) # Check length length(stannorm) [1] 31502 # Plot theoretical quantils against sorted residuals plot(stannorm, sortedresiduals) Figure 18.4: Handmade QQ-Norm plot of the EIA model residuals Shapiro-Wilks test for normality The research hypothesis for this test is in the title, i.e. is the data normally distributed? The Shapiro-Wilks (S-W) test is complicated but it sort of produces a statistic which relates to the straightness of the QQ-norm plot. The null hypothesis is \\(H_0\\): the data are normally distributed. If the p-value is large (e.g. \\(&gt;0.05\\)) then we fail to reject \\(H_0\\), i.e. the data is plausibly normally distributed. The S-W test for model1 is: shapiro.test(sample(residuals(model1), size=3000, replace=FALSE)) Shapiro-Wilk normality test data: sample(residuals(model1), size = 3000, replace = FALSE) W = 0.14597, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16 N.B. R allows only a maximum of 3000 points entered into the Shapiro-Wilks tests hence the use of the sample command to select a random sample of points. From the plots and output, we conclude that for model1: The data are not normally distributed The histogram is right skewed The points in the QQ-Norm plot do not lie on straight line The p-value for the S-W test is very small - we reject the null hypothesis that the data is normally distributed. The skewness could be affecting the inference about model parameters, and we would have to resort to a method which does not assume normality (e.g. a bootstrap-based method) for comparison. We advise using QQ-Norm plots for ascertaining if residuals are normally distributed (others may disagree): We only require the noise model is approximately normal (and there are no normal distributions in reality) Large samples tend to fail normality tests even though they are very close to normal. 18.3.2 Assessing constant error variance We assume the errors (our model for the noise) are well described by a normal distribution with mean zero and variance (\\(\\sigma^2\\)), i.e. \\(\\epsilon \\sim N(0,\\sigma^2)\\). We can assess the assumptions about the errors using the estimates for these errors, the residuals (\\(y-\\hat{y}\\)). We assume error variance is a constant and does not increase or decrease with covariates or the fitted values. Of course - its only one normal distribution! If this assumption is violated then the standard errors and \\(p\\)-values associated with each covariate will be the wrong size. We can check this assumption visually by plotting the fitted values (\\(\\hat{y}\\)) versus the residuals. We should see a pattern-less horizontal band if constant error variance is reasonable (e.g. see code below). We can also check this more formally using a Breusch-Pagan test (\\(H_0\\): constant error variance) and non-constant error variance is evidenced by a large test statistic and small \\(p\\)-value. We compare these tests for residuals that are normally distributed and the residuals from model1. First, the perfect data (Figure 18.5). # Generate perfect data set.seed (101) x &lt;- seq(1,1000) y &lt;- 2*x+rnorm (1000,0,5) df1 &lt;- data.frame (x,y) # Fit model to perfect data modelperfect &lt;- lm (y~x) # Plot fitted values against residuals plot (fitted(modelperfect), residuals(modelperfect)) Figure 18.5: Plot of fitted values against residuals - there is no pattern in the residuals. # Formal test ncvTest(modelperfect) Non-constant Variance Score Test Variance formula: ~ fitted.values Chisquare = 0.6569132, Df = 1, p = 0.41765 The \\(p\\)-value associated with the test statistic for normally distributed data is 0.42 which suggests unsurprisingly, no problem. Compare this to the residuals from model1 which show a very distinct pattern (Figure 18.6): # Plot fitted values against residuals plot (fitted (model1), residuals (model1)) Figure 18.6: Plot of fitted values against residuals from the EIA model1 showing a distinct pattern. # Formal test ncvTest(model1) Non-constant Variance Score Test Variance formula: ~ fitted.values Chisquare = 26372.76, Df = 1, p = &lt; 2.22e-16 The residuals in Figure 18.6 appear to violate the constant error variance assumption; the variance of the residuals appears to increase with the fitted values, and there is also a boundary effect because the density cannot be less than one. The Breusch-Pagan test suggests strong evidence of non-constant error variance (\\(p\\)-value&lt;0.0001). Figure 18.6 has many points and is therefore very difficult to interpret: For this reason, uncluttering this plot by dividing the fitted range into non-overlapping categories and calculating the variance of the residuals in each category is helpful, for example (Figure 18.7). Figure 18.7: The fitted values against the variance of the residuals (simplified) for a model similar to the interaction based model. The variance assumed under the model is represented by the solid horizontal line. It can clearly be seen that the variance does increase with an increase in fitted values. In the models we have fitted to the EIA data, there is: An increasing mean-variance relationship: The residual variance clearly increases with the fitted values (Figure 18.6) which violates a key assumption. At this point any model conclusions are purely speculative - we need to improve our model before we can reliably interpret any \\(p\\)-values. We have not commented on the negative densities predicted by the model (Figure 18.6, x-axis): We can also see the current model returns negative fitted values, while the input data (counts/area) are never negative. This is a common problem when fitting normal-errors based models to continuous data that is bounded by zero. We will address this problem in the next chapter. 18.3.3 Assessing independence A crucial model assumption is that the errors are independent and are not correlated in time/space. This assumption is really, really, important! Violation of this assumption means the standard errors and \\(p\\)-values are systematically too small (or large) and we risk drawing the wrong conclusion about model covariates. We can visually check for correlation in the residuals by plotting the residuals in observation order (if observation order is relevant) and, if we have independence, there should be no systematic patterns (e.g. Figure 18.8). The null hypothesis of uncorrelated errors can also be formally tested using a Durbin-Watson test: This test is based on the idea that if consecutive residuals are correlated then consecutive residuals will be related, The null hypothesis is that the residuals are uncorrelated, i.e. \\(H_0: \\rho=0\\) (e.g. Figure 18.8), versus the alternative hypothesis that \\(H_1: \\rho \\neq 0\\), a test statistic is generated based on sequential differences in the residuals. The test statistic is then compared against a critical value and this determines the associated \\(p\\)-value. As with other hypothesis tests, a small \\(p\\)-value provides evidence against \\(H_0\\) and would suggest correlated errors. Figure 18.8: Residuals from a model fitted to data simulated under a linear model with normal errors, plotted in order.There is no systematic pattern in the residuals and they switch between positive and negative residuals at random. The residuals of model1 appear to be correlated when plotted in observation order (Figure 18.9) and the Durbin-Watson test (below) confirms this positive correlation: the correlation coefficient is \\(0.15\\) and the \\(p\\)-value is extremely small). library(car) # Plot first 100 points plot (seq(1,100), residuals(model1)[1:100], type=&quot;l&quot;, xlab=&quot;Sequence&quot;) points(seq(1,100), residuals(model1)[1:100]) abline (h=0,lty=2) Figure 18.9: The first 100 residuals in model1 # Formal test durbinWatsonTest(model1) lag Autocorrelation D-W Statistic p-value 1 0.1495375 1.700924 0 Alternative hypothesis: rho != 0 In this case, we could be falsely concluding that one, or more variables, are related to the response because the standard errors are underestimated because of the positive correlation. 18.3.4 Pseudoreplication Independence may by violated in more philosophical ways which cannot be detected by a test e.g. pseudoreplication. Pseudoreplication is an inappropriate level of replication for the hypothesis under consideration. For example, if we were interested in the question Does drinking a cup of coffee raise blood sugar? a control person could be given a glass of warm water and a treatment person a cup of coffee. Twenty blood samples could be then be taken from each subject. However, it would be wrong to assume this was a sample size of 40 because the samples are not independent. In reality, we have two samples, one from each person. Treating the data points as 40 independent samples would be an example of pseudo replication. However, pseudoreplication can be difficult to spot. Imagine we were investigating the hypothesis that chimps change their activity when in zoos. It would be tempting to sample the behaviour (for example, frequency of face scratching per hour) of 20 chimps from say Edinburgh zoo and compare them to 20 chimps from a troop of chimps in the wild. But is this really 40 independent data points? Perhaps the appropriate sampling unit is troop so we really only have two data points (a mean from each chimp group). 18.3.5 Linearity in the model for the signal The signal in the simple linear model is assumed to be linear. Despite the name `linear model, this does not mean simple straight lines apply. For example, this is a linear model, but can be very curvaceous: \\[ y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x + \\beta_2 x^2 + \\beta_3 x^3 + \\beta_4 x^4 + ... + \\beta_p x^p + \\epsilon \\] However, this type of model is beyond this module. When fitting regression models it is useful to ask the questions: Have I fitted straight lines where curves should be used? Have I included the covariates that give rise to the signal? Have I fitted factors where appropriate? Single variable case With only one explanatory variable, non-linearity will be easy to spot by simply plotting the variables i.e. \\(x\\) against \\(y\\). Examples are shown in Figure 18.10: Figure 18.10: Non-linear signals in the data. Two sets of data that show different non-linear signals between the response and explanatory variables. More formally, we typically plot a fits-residual plot (i.e. fitted values on the \\(x\\)-axis and residuals on the \\(y\\)-axis) as previously used to check for non-constant error variance but it can also be used to check for nonlinearity. Example Consider the non-linear data in Figure 18.10. The corresponding fits-residual plots are shown in (Figure 18.11) and these indicate distinct patterns. par (mfrow =(c(1,2))) model1 &lt;- lm (y1~x1) plot (fitted (model1), residuals (model1)) model2 &lt;- lm (y2~x2) plot (fitted (model2), residuals (model2)) Figure 18.11: Non-linearity in the residuals. In both these non-linear cases, a distinct pattern can be seen in the fits-residual plot implying some unaccounted for signal in the model. A linear model is not sufficient for these data. Any pattern in the fits-residual plot could be caused by error heterogeneity (non-constant variance) or by a mis-specified model. 18.4 Example: Diagnostics with the medical data We now illustrate diagnostics for a simple linear model fitted to the medical data. We fit two simple regression models and check the diagnostics for each model; the first model does not fulfill all the assumptions of a linear model. As a reminder, lets look at the data available in the TEON data set: head(meddata, n=2) gend age vitdresul vitdc vit.12 vitbc folate TEON teonpres ageTEON 1 female 50 10.98 insufficiency 310 normal 19.17 Yes 1 YesOld 2 female 39 13.46 insufficiency 238 normal 8.16 Yes 1 YesOld Let us consider diagnostics for a linear model where a factor (presence/absence of TEON) is used as an explanatory variable to model vitamin D level (vitdresul). With two factor levels, this is like a two sample \\(t\\) test. # Set No to be reference level for TEON meddata$TEON &lt;- relevel(as.factor(meddata$TEON), ref=&#39;No&#39;) # Fit model with factor TEON_lm &lt;- lm(vitdresul ~ TEON, data=meddata) # Summary of model summary(TEON_lm) Call: lm(formula = vitdresul ~ TEON, data = meddata) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -10.1262 -3.7462 -0.2462 2.4929 20.3938 Coefficients: Estimate Std.

Each datum comes from a different patient/subject and so the independence assumption should be satisfied. We now check the constant variance assumption using a Breusch-Pagan test on the residuals. # Non-constant variance test ncvTest(TEON_lm) Non-constant Variance Score Test Variance formula: ~ fitted.values Chisquare = 2.056848, Df = 1, p = 0.15152 If the residuals were heteroscadastic (The property of the variances not being homogeneous) then these data could be analysed using a two sample \\(t\\) test, specifying that the variances were unequal. However, all is well; we can now investigate normality of the residuals. # Save residuals estNoise &lt;- residuals(TEON_lm) # Histogram of residuals hist(estNoise) Figure 18.12: Histogram of medical residuals This histogram looks roughly normal but it is wise to test further. # QQ-Norm plot qqnorm(estNoise) Figure 18.13: QQ-Norm plot of the medical model residuals. # Test of normality shapiro.test(estNoise) Shapiro-Wilk normality test data: estNoise W = 0.93151, p-value = 0.002304 So the normality assumption has not been met.

To formally check, we can undertake a Breusch-Pagan test for non-constant variance. ncvTest(simpleReg) Non-constant Variance Score Test Variance formula: ~ fitted.values Chisquare = 0.04315852, Df = 1, p = 0.83543 Based on these results, there is no reason to reject \\(H_0\\) that the residuals are homogeneous. The next step is to evaluate the normality of the residuals with a QQ-Norm plot and a formal test. qqnorm(residuals (simpleReg)) Figure 18.14: QQ-Norm plot of the medical model residuals shapiro.test(residuals(simpleReg)) Shapiro-Wilk normality test data: residuals(simpleReg) W = 0.96905, p-value = 0.1311 There is little evidence of non-normality from the QQ plot and the \\(p\\)-value of the S-W test is \\(&gt;0.1\\) so we fail to reject the null hypothesis that the data are normally distributed. In this case the assumption of normality seems justified. 18.5 Partial residual plots The assumptions for multiple linear regression models are the same as for a simple linear model. However, identifying unexplained patterns in the data when there are more explanatory variables is rather more difficult, as might be expected. We have an immediate problem in that one, or more, of the terms may be mis-specified. Example Imagine the following situation: the (unknown) true relationship between two predictors, \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\), and a dependent \\(y\\) variable is: \\[y_i= sin (4x_1)+0.01x_2+\\epsilon\\] An analyst fits the following model: \\[y_i= \\beta_0 +\\beta_1x_1+\\beta_2x_2+\\epsilon\\] The analyst goes on to check the model diagnostics and plots the fitted values against the residuals (Figure 18.15). Figure 18.15: Fits-residual plot in multiple regression case. Clearly there is a problem identifiable in the fits-residual plot (Figure 18.15), but the analyst does not know if the non-linearity is caused by \\(x_1\\) or \\(x_2\\) or both or even another variable not considered in the model. To address this problem, we use partial (residual) plots: These show residuals and relationships between \\(y\\) and individual \\(x\\), with adjustment for the other \\(x\\) variables in the model. The partial residuals (for the \\(p\\)-th covariate/predictor) are found by adding the estimated relationship (for the \\(p\\)-th predictor; \\(\\hat{\\beta}_px_{pi}\\)) to the residuals for the model (\\(r_{it}\\)): \\[\\begin{equation} r_{pi}=r_{i}+\\hat{\\beta}_px_{pi} \\end{equation}\\] and when the \\(x\\)-variable (\\(x_{pi}\\)) is plotted with the partial residuals (\\(r_{pi}\\)) we have a partial residual plot. To return to the example, the analyst generates partial residuals plots along with a best fit line, actually just the slope of the relevant variable (Figure 18.16). Call: lm(formula = y ~ x1 + x2) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -1.70373 -0.58648 0.08128 0.48741 2.02934 Coefficients: Estimate Std.

In this example, the problem lies with \\(x_2\\) (in fact a \\(sin\\) function was being treated as linear). Partial residuals have several useful diagnostic properties: the slope of the line is the regression coefficient, the extent of the scatter tells us about the support for the function, we can identify large residuals and curved plots signal non-linear relationships. 18.5.1 Doing this in R As usual, a shortcut for making partial residuals in R is available. In the car library, the function crPlots provides a convenient function with a fit of the function as modelled and a smooth function through the residuals to highlight any pattern (Figure 18.17). cr is shorthand for component residual which is another name for partial plots. # Partial residual plots crPlots(modelboth) Figure 18.17: Partial residual plots from the car library Returning to the EIA data, the partial plots for model1 are shown in Figure 18.18. model1 &lt;- lm(Density ~ XPos + YPos + DistCoast + Depth + Month + Phase, data=wfdata) # Partial residual plots crPlots(model1) Figure 18.18: Partial residual plots in the EIA model From these plots: It is hard to determine if linearity is reasonable for the continuous covariates due to the size of the partial residuals. The coefficients for each phase appear to be very similar (implying the relationship between density and phase may be weak) but there seems to be bigger differences across months. When the size of the partial residuals render this diagnostic ineffective, comparing the penalized fit for more complex models (e.g. with smoother based terms for each continuous covariate) with the current model is useful (Beyond the remit of this module). 18.6 Interaction Terms Simple partial residual plots dont work with interactions, so we need to do something slightly more complex: Recall that an interaction (\\(\\beta_s(x_1 \\times x_2)\\), say) means that the relationship between \\(y\\) and \\(x_1\\) is conditional on the values of \\(x_2\\). We condition on some values for one of the interaction \\(x\\)s (we slice up the interaction). For factor variables this is relatively easy - we can look at each factor level in turn. We can use the effect command from the effects library. This collects the effect of a particular variable by predicting for the variable assuming all other terms in the model are held constant and the only thing that varies are the interaction and the terms marginal to it (Figures 18.19) and ??. # Load necessary libraries require(effects) require(ggExtra) # Fit model with interactions model2 &lt;- lm(Density ~ XPos + YPos + DistCoast + Depth + Month + Phase + XPos:Phase, data=wfdata) # Plot partial residuals plot(effect(&quot;XPos:Phase&quot;, model2, ylab=&quot;XPos&quot;, rug=TRUE, partial.residuals=T)) Figure 18.19: Partial residual plots for interactions There may be something odd going on here, but the shear density of data makes it difficult to interpret; in each case there is are some peaks worthy of further investigation. Q18.1 Dr Teuthis was interested in the relationship of squid beak size (measured as a statistic called lower rostral length) to body (mantle) length Figure ( 18.20 ) . It would be helpful to be able to predict mantle length from beak size in order to estimate the size of squid swallowed by sperm whales. Squid beaks are retained in the whales gut before being vomited out, when they then can be collected. Figure 18.20: Regression of mantle length on lower rostral length A simple linear regression model is fitted below. modelBeaktoMantle = lm (ML~ LRL.beak, data=squidtemp) Q18.1 Write down the general equation of the model being fitted. Q18.2 The model generated the following diagnostics: Figure 18.21: Squid diagnostics What distribution are the residuals assumed to be from? Q18.3 Explain these diagnostic plots and what they are checking. Q18.4 An additional test was performed: ncvTest(modelBeaktoMantle) Non-constant Variance Score Test Variance formula: ~ fitted.values Chisquare = 0.6905414, Df = 1, p = 0.40598 Based on these test results and the residual plots, comment on the suitability of fitting a linear model to these data. What further testing could be undertaken? Q18.5 Troubled by the diagnostics above, Dr Teuthis elects to transform his dependent data (a method frequently used to ensure the variance of the residuals is constant, or, in other words, the same for all residuals) by calculating the log of mantle length. He then refits the model with log(ML) as the response variable and gets the following diagnostics. modelBeaktolnMantle = lm(log(ML) ~ LRL.beak,data=squidtemp) plot (fitted (modelBeaktolnMantle), residuals(modelBeaktolnMantle)) qqnorm(residuals(modelBeaktolnMantle)) ncvTest (modelBeaktolnMantle) Non-constant Variance Score Test Variance formula: ~ fitted.values Chisquare = 14.38298, Df = 1, p = 0.00014914 Comment on these diagnostics. Q18.6 Suggest an alternative approach to ensure the model assumptions are valid. Q18.7 Why has Dr Teuthis not considered a Durbin-Watson test here? 18.7 Summary Linear models allow us to fit complex models. However, they do come with certain conditions that need to be fulfilled for the results to be reliable. In essence the constraints are: A model for signal that is correct - we can make anything that is linear in its parameters The model for noise is that it be independent realisations of a single normal distribution If some of these assumptions are not valid for our data, then we can try to tackle the issue, however, it may require methods that are beyond this course. Nevertheless, being able to recognise this is useful. Non-normality can be tackled by bootstrapping, transformations, or alternative models beyond the level of this course Non-independence if present, is a real problem that needs alternative methods beyond this course. More complex or better models for the signal can use alternative models beyond this course. 18.7.1 Learning outcomes At this end of this chapter you should be able to: recognise whether modelling assumptions have been been met. manipulate the models or data in such a way that the assumptions can be met recognise whether methods more complex than covered here may be required. 18.8 Answers Q18.1 The general equation is: \\[ML= \\beta_0+\\beta_1LRLbeak+ \\epsilon\\] Q18.2 Residuals are assumed to be from a normal distribution with a mean = 0 and a constant variance, i.e. \\(N(0,\\ {\\sigma{}}^2)\\). Q18.3 The top plot (residuals v fitted values) is a visual check that the variance is constant for all residuals (i.e. checking that the spread (a measure of the variation) of the residuals above and below zero is the same for all fitted values). An obvious pattern in the residuals would indicate a non-constant variance and potentially that residuals were not independent (because they would contain some unexplained pattern). The normal Q-Q plot is a plot of the quantiles of the (standardised) residuals against the quantiles from a reference normal distribution. If the residuals are normally distributed, the points should lie on, or close to, a straight line but there is often some deviation at the ends of the line. This provides a visual check of the normality of the residuals. Q18.4 This is a tricky one. It appears from the plot of residuals against fitted values (top plot) that there might be heterogeneity in the residuals (i.e. differences in the spread, above and below zero, of residuals along the \\(x\\)-axis) suggesting a non-constant variance: however, the non-constant variance test result does not support this impression. The impression from the plot may occur because there are only a few points at low fitted values, although common sense would suggest that mantle length might vary rather more in big squids than in squids only a few cm long. The distribution of the residuals does not seem to be perfectly normal. The gap in the lower rostral length (between 0.005m to 0.01m approx), whilst not fatal to the analysis, should make the analyst wary. A Shapiro-Wilks test could be undertaken on the residuals to further test for normality. Q18.5 Arguably, these plots are worse than the first set of diagnostics because there is an obvious pattern in the top plot. Transforming ML may have generated a curve in the residuals. The normal Q-Q plot appears to have improved (more points lying on a straight line) but there are also a few points at the ends of the line that are a long way from the line. Q18.6 There are three small values of lower rostral length (LRLbeak) and these might be regarded as problematic or outliers. Perhaps there is a different relationship of mantle length to LRLbeak at this size and so these three points could be excluded and the model refitted. Q18.7 The Durbin-Watson test is used to detect the presence of autocorrelation in the residuals. The data do not represent a time series or ordered in some systematic way and so there is no a priori reason to believe that there should be any autocorrelation in the data.

This is the case for both the simple and more complex models presented in this module. If the assumptions are not met there may be adjustments, alternative tests or more advanced statistical methods that can be implemented. Here; we explore some simple ways to overcome such problems with distributional assumptions as well as introduce some advanced methods that may be available. 19.2 Solving the assumptional problems Previous chapters have described model diagnostics to check the model assumptions, and so, armed with this information, we can revisit, our conclusions about what influences density in the EIA data set for example, and evaluate the model in terms of the assumptions. However, what happens if assumptions (for any linear model) are not met? While this is a cause for concern, there are various approaches that can be adopted in these circumstances. 19.2.1 Example: The EIA data At this point it appears from previous chapters there are no differences in the average density across the three development phases but some evidence for differences in the easting (X-coordinate) relationship across phases. While this may be indicative of the true situation, in practise we need to do more to be able to answer our research questions. Although our model appears to fit the data adequately (\\(R^2\\)-wise), our model returns impossible predictions (negative density estimates) and the assumptions appear to be violated. More specifically the problems are: The model for signal is likely a little simple: The variables X and Y are spatial co-ordinates and using simple lines to describe them may not be adequate to capture all the pattern in density. The model for noise is wrong: The residuals are not normal in shape (with the implied constant variance). The estimated errors dont appear independent (not surprisingly because density was measured at locations along lines and density at locations which are close together may be similar). Therefore, the conclusions from the model are unsafe and cannot be relied upon. This is a very common situation in practise. What can be done? 19.2.2 Oddly distributed residuals One important assumption of the linear models discussed so far is that the residuals are normally distributed with the same variance i.e. \\(\\epsilon_i \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2)\\); this assumption is not always met in practise. If the residuals are not normally distributed, then various options are available to account for this: the dependent data (response) can be transformed (e.g. by taking the logarithm or square root) to address the distributional shape problems. This is effective but the consequence is that: the geometric mean is modelled rather than the arithmetic mean if for example a log transformation is used, interactions found in the untransformed data may disappear (this may not be a problem, a multiplicative relationship has just become a additive one). Generalised linear models (GLMs) allow different shaped distributions for noise. These models are covered in another course. Generalised Least Squares (GLS) methods can help with non-constant variance. These methods are also covered in another module. A bootstrap can be used to obtain approximate measures of uncertainty that do not rely on the distributional assumptions (see below). 19.2.3 Non-independence We have four options if the data are not independent. We can: ignore the correlation in the residuals (easy but unwise). investigate other key variables that can account for the dependence. try to remove the correlation in model residuals by sub-setting the data (for example, re-run analysis using every 20th observation; this reduces the sample size and wastes information) account for the correlation using, for example, a Generalized Least Squares (GLS) or Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) model - this is another course. 19.2.4 Non-linearity If a straight line is not appropriate then we can use: more complex linear models (i.e. more variables), non-linear (in the everyday sense) functions (i.e. Generalised Additive Models GAMs) or many other predictive modelling tools, if you only care about prediction (rather than explanation/description) of the response. 19.2.5 Bootstrapping The bootstrap has been described previously. You can think of it as simulating more samples, but using our data as a basis for determining uncertainty. In general, the bootstrap procedure consists of: generating a new data set of the same dimensions, by sampling the rows of our original data with replacement (a non-parametric bootstrap), we do this many times and fit models each time, storing the estimates of the statistic of interest. This shows roughly how much things might change if we were to have another sample. The collective set of estimates provides a distribution of estimates, from which we infer/generate confidence intervals for the parameters. Here we implement an example of bootstrapping a simple linear regression model to obtain an approximate confidence interval for the regression coefficients (i.e. the intercept and slope). Suppose that we have fitted a simple linear regression model and we are reasonably happy that a simple linear model is appropriate (i.e. the model for the signal is suitable) and the independence assumption is valid. However, diagnostic plots indicate that the residuals are not normally distributed. We would like to interpret the parameter estimates - in particular with consideration to the uncertainty (e.g. confidence intervals) and the conventional CI may be incorrect if the distributional assumptions are violated. As indicated, the general bootstrap procedure is: Sample the data, with replacement, to give an equivalently dimensioned data set Fit the linear model to this new bootstrap sample - store the parameter estimates Repeat this process many times (e.g. at least 1000 times) Take, say, the central 95% of these estimates as an approximate 95% confidence interval The advantage of a bootstrap is that if the residual distribution is very skewed, then youll naturally get skewed 95% CIs which are more appropriate. Example In the code below a simple linear regression model is fitted to the EIA data with Depth as the response and DistCoast as the explanatory variable. A bootstrap procedure is then implemented to obtain CI for the regression coefficients. For ease of producing the plots, the process was repeated only a 100 times, but properly it should be at least 1000. library(dplyr) # Create an object to store results bootCoefs&lt;- array(dim = c(100, 2)) # Select only necessary columns workingDataorig &lt;- wfdata %&gt;% select(DistCoast, Depth) # Fit model to original data model1 &lt;- lm (Depth ~ DistCoast, data=workingDataorig) # Start bootstrap loop for (i in 1:100) { # Select a random subset (to make computations tractable for example) workingData &lt;- workingDataorig[sample(1:nrow(workingDataorig), 200),] # Generate bootstrap sample of row numbers bootIndex &lt;- sample(1:nrow(workingData), nrow(workingData), replace=T) # Select data based on sample of row numbers bootData &lt;- workingData[bootIndex, ] # Fit linear model bootLM &lt;- lm(Depth ~ DistCoast, data=bootData) # Store coefficients bootCoefs[i,] &lt;- coefficients(bootLM) } # Obtain 95% quantiles for the coefficients bootCI &lt;- apply(bootCoefs, 2, quantile, probs = c(0.025, 0.975)) # Add column names colnames(bootCI) &lt;- c(&#39;Intercept&#39;, &#39;Slope&#39;) # Use these to define a colour with some transparancy (alpha) myCol &lt;- rgb(160, 32, 240, alpha=30, max=255) # Plot data and all bootstrap regression lines plot(workingData$DistCoast, workingData$Depth, cex=1.5, xlab=&#39;Distance from coast&#39;, ylab=&quot;depth&quot;, bg=&#39;orange&#39;, pch = 21, main=&#39;&#39;, sub=&#39;&#39;) # Original regression line (black) abline (model1, lwd=2) # Add bootstrap regression lines apply(bootCoefs, 1, abline, col=myCol, lwd=1.5) Figure 19.1: The best fit line (black) with bootstrap replicate best fit lines (purple).

Suffice it to say it can be incredibly useful see Davison &amp; Hinckley (1997). 19.3 Summary Diagnostic plots indicate whether the assumptions of the linear model are valid. If not, there are several solutions to violated linear model assumptions. Non-normality can be tackled by bootstrapping, transformations, or alternative models beyond the level of this course Non-independence is a real problem - need alternative methods beyond this course. More complex or better models for the signal - alternative models beyond this course. Beyond the linear model As already hinted, linear models are part of a far wider class of models that can handle complex data in a regression framework. As well as the model assumptions to check, there are other considerations to take account of. For example are your samples representative of the population under consideration i.e. does the result have external validity? Is the (experimental) design of data collection such that no biases could occur. This is far more difficult to ensure than might be thought. Aspects such as how statistical data should be presented in order to provide useful summaries? What is best practise? All this and more is considered in the module Statistical Thinking. 19.3.1 Learning outcomes At this end of this chapter you should be able to: use some methods to overcome assumption violations of the linear model, and recognise when methods beyond this course may be appropriate.

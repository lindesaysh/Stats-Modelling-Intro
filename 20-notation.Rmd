# Notation {#notation}

Throughout the course standard notation is used in order to express the ideas and concepts in a precise and concise mathematical representation. This section describes the notation which is used and provides a reference as you work through the module. The R functions associated with some of the mathematical operators are listed. 

## Summation 

$$\sum_{i=1} ^{n} x_i = x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_n$$

__Example__ Suppose we have collected the ages of five primary school children and the ages are 5, 6, 7, 9 and 10. Let $x$ represent age, then the total age will be 

$$ \sum_{i=1}^{n=5}x_i = 5 + 6 + 7 + 9 + 10 = 37$$
__Usage__ Occurs frequently in statistical expressions, such as the sample mean. 

__R function__ `sum`

## Factorial

$$n! = 1 \times 2 \times 3 \times ... \times n$$ 

__Example__ Suppose, we have a sample of five so that $n = 5$, thus 

$$5! = 1 \times 2 \times 3 \times 4 \times 5 = 120 $$

__Usage__ This notation is used in the formula for calculating combinations of samples (see below).

__R function__ `factorial`

## Combinations

$${n \choose r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$$

__Example__ How many ways are there to choose 2 objects from a set of 4 objects. 
$${4 \choose 2} = \frac{4!}{(4-2)!2!} = 6$$

__Usage__ This notation is used when calculating the possible numbers of combinations of samples (when order does not matter).

__R function__ `choose`

## Multiplication

$$\prod_{i=1} ^{n} x_i = x_1 \times x_2 \times ...\times x_n$$
__Example__ We want to multiply together the following numbers 2, 3 and 4. Let $x_i$ represent the three numbers.  

$$\prod_{i=1} ^{3} x_i = 2 \times 3 \times 4 = 24$$

__Usage__ Probability calculations. 

__R function__ `prod`

## Integration

$$\int_a^b f(x) dx $$

This notation means integrate the function specified by $f(x)$ between the limits $a$ to $b$. 

__Usage__ Used to calculate the area under curves, for example in hypothesis testing to calculate $p$-values. 

## Matrix multiplication

For matrix multiplication the number of columns in the first matrix must equal the number of rows in the second matrix. It is best illustrated with an example.  
$$
\left[\begin{array}
{ccc}
1 & 2 & 3 \\
4 & 5 & 6 \\
\end{array}\right] 
\left[\begin{array}
{cc}
7 & 8\\
9 & 10 \\
11 & 12 \\
\end{array}\right] 
= 
\left[\begin{array}
{cc}
58 & 64 \\
139 & 154 \\
\end{array}\right] 
$$

where 
$$ 58 = 1 \times 7 + 2 \times 9 + 3 \times 11$$
$$ 64 = 1 \times 8 + 2 \times 10 + 3 \times 12$$
$$ 139 = 4 \times 7 + 5 \times 9 + 6 \times 11$$
$$ 154 = 4 \times 8 + 5 \times 10 + 6 \times 12$$

__Usage__ Efficient description of linear models. 

## Absolute values

An absolute value, or modulus, is the non-negative value of a number $x$ without regard to its sign. It is denoted by $|x|$. For example $|5| = 5$ and $|-5| = 5$.

__R function__ `abs`

## $\pi$

$\pi$ is a mathematical constant - the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter. It's value is `r format(pi, digits=6)`.

__R function__ `pi`

## Exponential function, $e$

$e = 2.718$ is the natural exponential function, often used $e^x$. 

__Example__ $$e^2 = 7.389$$

__Usage__ Used to describe a quantity that increases, or decreases, at a rate that is proportional to its value, for example, the probability mass function to describe a Poisson random variable. 

__R function__ `exp`

## Scientific notation

Scientific notation is a way of expressing numbers that are too large or too small to conveniently write in decimal form. In R, a number is expressed as a decimal and an exponent, separated by `e` (not to be confused with the exponential function). Some examples are given below. 

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l|l|l}
Decimal & Scientific notation & R notation\\
\hline
1234.0 & $1.234 \times 10^3$ & 1.234e3\\
0.01234 & $1.234 \times 10^{-2}$ & \textrm{1.234e-2}\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

## Intervals

Parentheses $(.)$ and square brackets $[.]$ are used to indicate an interval. The notation $[a, b]$ is used to indicate a set of numbers from $a$ to $b$ and including $a$ and $b$. The notation $(a, b)$ indicates the set of numbers from $a$ to $b$ but excluding $a$ and $b$. Thus, [3, 8) will be the set of numbers from, and including 3, to 8 but not including 8. 

## Axes on plots

$x$-axis - the horizontal axis generally used for the explanatory variable.

$y$-axis - the vertical axis generally used the response variable.

## Probability

Notation is used when expressing probability and probability rules. A few symbols are provided here. 

$\mathcal{S}$ or $\Omega$ - sample space

$\emptyset$ - empty set

$\cap$ - 'and'. For example, If $A$ and $B$ are two events, then $A \cap B$ is interpreted as $A$ and $B$.

$\cup$ - 'or'. For example, $A \cup B$ is interpreted as $A$ or $B$.
